(VMounting trade friction between the\u000aU.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting\u000anations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic\u000adamage, businessmen and officials said.\u000a    They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.\u000aMove against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the\u000aU.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.\u000a    But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt\u000athem in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be\u000atheir gain.\u000a    The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on\u000aimports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in\u000aretaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not\u000ato sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.\u000a    Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs\u000aat 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms\u000asaid they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the\u000anew taxes.\u000a    "We wouldn't be able to do business," said a spokesman for\u000aleading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric\u000aIndustrial Co Ltd <MC.T>.\u000a    "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time\u000abeyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of\u000aexports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.," said Tom\u000aMurtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker <James\u000aCapel and Co>.\u000a    In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.\u000a    "We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against\u000aJapan because it serves as a warning to us," said a senior\u000aTaiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.\u000a    Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last\u000ayear, 95 pct of it with the U.S.\u000a    The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves\u000ato 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.\u000a    "We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and\u000acut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we\u000awant to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation," said\u000aPaul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters <Taiwan Safe Group>.\u000a    A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion\u000aassociation said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan\u000amight also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports\u000aare similar to those of Japan.\u000a    Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion\u000adlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.\u000a    In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough\u000acurbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of\u000asemiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the\u000aU.S.\u000a    In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been\u000aselling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics\u000amanufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such\u000aa short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by\u000afurther U.S. Pressure to block imports.\u000a    "That is a very short-term view," said Lawrence Mills,\u000adirector-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.\u000a    "If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will\u000abe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong\u000ais the disadvantage of action restraining trade," he said.\u000a    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,\u000aaccounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.\u000a    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade\u000atalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,\u000aIndustry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.\u000a    "This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two\u000acountries which are major trading partners of ours is a very\u000aserious matter," Button said.\u000a    He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,\u000aAustralia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant\u000aU.S. Exports to that country.\u000a    Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the\u000atrade stand-off continue.\u000a    Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined\u000aa package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.\u000a    The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget\u000aand record public works spending in the first half of the\u000afinancial year.\u000a    They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency\u000ameasure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister\u000aYasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.\u000a    Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto\u000aKuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and\u000aIndustry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an\u000aeffort to end the dispute.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VSumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMI.T> is certain to\u000alose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of\u000aits merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.\u000a    Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9\u000atrillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank\u000awith an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in\u000aOctober.\u000a    But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu\u000atold Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its\u000aposition.\u000a    "We'll be back in position in first place within three\u000ayears," Komatsu said in an interview.\u000a    He said that while the merger will initially reduce\u000aSumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand\u000aSumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where\u000ait has been relatively weak.\u000a    But financial analysts are divided on whether and how\u000aquickly the gamble will pay off.\u000a    Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in\u000aview of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger\u000awas more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\u000anetwork from scratch.\u000a    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has\u000aexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\u000aand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\u000awisdom of some of those moves.\u000a    "They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\u000ait's largely out of their hands," said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\u000afinancial analyst Simon Smithson.\u000a    Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to\u000aenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\u000ainvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\u000a    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\u000apct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\u000aleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\u000apersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\u000a    "The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\u000aFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected," said one analyst.\u000a    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\u000a    "U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\u000awe can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\u000ayears, not until the 21st century," Komatsu said.\u000a    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\u000ainto the securities business at home.\u000a    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's\u000aversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\u000afrom investment banking.\u000a    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\u000asaid he hopes further deregulation will create new\u000aopportunities.\u000a    "We need to find new business chances," Komatsu said. "In some\u000acases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\u000abank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."\u000a    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\u000adomestic securities business as profitable government bond\u000adealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\u000aLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\u000a    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\u000athe securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\u000asubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\u000a     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\u000asecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\u000afollowing a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\u000auniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\u000a    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\u000adecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\u000a    "We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\u000ain two or three years," he said.\u000a    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\u000alending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\u000areplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\u000a    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\u000atime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\u000amerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\u000a    "It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies," said\u000aKleinwort's Smithson.\u000a    "After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling\u000aaround.

Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has\u000abeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year\u000abeef accord next March 31.\u000a    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales\u000afrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports\u000afrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although\u000athe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.\u000a    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its\u000abeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain\u000aimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.\u000a    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when\u000aUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has\u000athe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.\u000aAgricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing\u000asome one billion dlrs in new business.\u000a    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs\u000aand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import\u000acontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,\u000apurees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,\u000aprepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.\u000a    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's\u000atop business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove\u000aresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.\u000a    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional\u000areaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue\u000ashould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the\u000aindustrial sector.\u000a    "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these\u000aissues should not be discussed on the same table," the official\u000asaid.\u000a REUTER\u000a

The surplus enabled the\u000acountry to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first\u000atime.\u000a    South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs\u000ain 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest\u000ain Asia.\u000a    "This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the\u000amajor constraints on our development...

a(VAustralian markets are booming as foreign\u000afund managers redirect capital away from the United States and\u000aother traditional markets, analysts said.\u000a    High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and\u000aan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of\u000afresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and\u000aU.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.\u000a    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in\u000aand have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they\u000adiversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.\u000a    A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in\u000athe past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the\u000acurrency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.\u000a    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital\u000aare not available, but brokers said they received almost daily\u000ainquiries from Japan and the United States.\u000a    "These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about\u000aand they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending\u000aup here with the attraction of high interest rates and\u000areasonable currency stability," National Australia Bank Ltd\u000aeconomist Brian Hamley said.\u000a    "There is a 'flight to quality'," Hamley said. "Australia may\u000anot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too\u000amany other countries where you'd want to put your money."\u000a    The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting\u000ainvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against\u000athe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.\u000a    "We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.\u000aWhere some people would be concerned about the value of the\u000aU.S. Dollar," Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose\u000asaid. "Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap\u000aand the currency looks stable?"\u000a    But turning that capital into more permanent productive\u000ainvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.\u000a    "It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the\u000adirection in the economy," Buttrose said, adding that offshore\u000ainvestors would carefully watch the government's promised tough\u000aeconomic statement on May 14.\u000a    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding\u000ainterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as\u000aeasily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were\u000abadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar\u000aand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\u000a    "It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be\u000adelivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one\u000amight see a substantial outflow," Buttrose said.\u000a    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough\u000aeconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and\u000astubborn current account deficit, analysts said.\u000a    "They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think\u000athey would like to leave the money here," Buttrose said.\u000a    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased\u000ainterest in investment in Australia and the need to shield\u000aJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.\u000a    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an\u000aelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currency\u000apolicy when he said authorities could not take their "eyes off\u000athe yen" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.\u000a    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked\u000asuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar\u000awithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.\u000a    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the\u000aAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a\u000atrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.\u000a    Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming\u000aAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other\u000amarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the\u000aweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into\u000aequities, particularly in the gold sector.\u000a    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3\u000atoday, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while\u000athe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the\u000asame period.\u000a    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese\u000acompanies that have invested heavily in the United States in\u000arecent years turning their attention to undervalued real\u000aestate, particularly in the tourism field.\u000a    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star\u000aRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs\u000aas indicative of the type of property being sought.\u000a    "They think they find good value real estate here which,\u000awith long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of\u000ainvestment Australia needs," Buttrose added.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VKuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden\u000aeconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices\u000awill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists\u000asay.\u000a    Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold\u000aoil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the\u000anorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.\u000a    Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross\u000adomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year\u000aafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.\u000a    This was after taking into account inflation in consumer\u000aprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.\u000a    Factors depressing economic activity include the\u000a6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which\u000athreatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the\u000aGulf and has sapped business confidence.\u000a    But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September\u000awhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis\u000acaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive\u000anew debt settlement program was introduced.\u000a    The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward\u000atrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.\u000a    The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer\u000aspending, thus generating an informal credit system.\u000a    Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are\u000astill owed by individuals and companies.\u000a    There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)\u000ain outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which\u000aone-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as\u000abad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it\u000awill not allow any banks to go under.\u000a    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of\u000aproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether\u000adebtors have regular cash flows or not.\u000a    Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights\u000aguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance\u000ain a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector\u000ais the biggest after oil.\u000a    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride\u000aout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.\u000a    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)\u000acompared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last\u000ayear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.\u000a    But strategic diversification into downstream operations in\u000aEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment at\u000ahome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell\u000aover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.\u000a    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average\u000a2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed\u000aproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as\u000acrude.\u000a    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason\u000afor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic\u000ainflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent\u000ayears and signs government spending on productive sectors will\u000aremain steady.\u000a    External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8\u000abillion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below\u000athat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit\u000aGulf.\u000a    Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put\u000aofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income\u000aof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.\u000a    But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these\u000areserves may not be enough to prevent a "real" budget deficit for\u000athe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.\u000a    In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,\u000arevenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,\u000adoubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.\u000a    This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded\u000ain official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at\u000aup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some\u000ashortfall.\u000a    Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for\u000aeconomic growth this year or next.\u000a    "It depends on oil prices," one said. "This summer is\u000aimportant."\u000a    Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday\u000athe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state\u000aspending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the\u000aeconomy.\u000a    He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be\u000aspelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VA bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) <SANM.MN>\u000ato buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut\u000aPlanters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources\u000ain the Philippine food and brewery company said.\u000a    A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB\u000afrom selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's\u000aoutstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on\u000aApril 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former\u000achairman of both SMC and UCPB.\u000a    Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)\u000aand 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.\u000a    Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and\u000arepresented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's\u000aplans to sell the shares to SMC were "a serious breach of\u000afiduciary duties."\u000a    The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be\u000aheld up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities\u000aand Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a\u000agovernment nominee on the company's board.\u000a    De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,\u000aasked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by\u000athe company's board.\u000a    On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the\u000asequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per\u000ashare. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained\u000aearnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the\u000apurchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of\u000adividends.\u000a    De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate\u000aan SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt\u000ato equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon\u000adel Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would\u000aboost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.\u000a    In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier\u000asuit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres\u000aSoriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.\u000a    De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming\u000alast December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong\u000asubsidiary <Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.\u000aThe loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board\u000ameeting.\u000a    An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to\u000aresolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by\u000aApril 15.\u000a    "The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of\u000aa continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard\u000aof the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early\u000adisposition of the sequestered shares," San Miguel Corp said in\u000aa statement.\u000a    "Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have\u000areached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of\u000apayment, this suit is in direct contravention of the\u000agovernment's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement\u000aof the controversy by April 15," the statement added.\u000a    A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on\u000aCojuangco's court petition, adding: "Any statement coming from\u000aus might be interpreted as adversarial."\u000a    Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which\u000asequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible\u000ato buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United\u000aStates citizen.\u000a    The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln "A" shares,\u000awhich can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln "B" shares which\u000aare available to foreign buyers.\u000a    SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among\u000aprospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by\u000athe <A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed\u000ainstitutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers\u000ain a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.\u000a    The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on\u000aGood Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were\u000aowned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President\u000aFerdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the\u000aU.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend\u000aannounced last June.\u000a    "We have no objection to Soriano buying the "B" shares," Diaz\u000atold Reuters. "But everything is on hold now."\u000a    The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy\u000awould be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'\u000ameeting, scheduled for May 14.\u000a    San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion\u000apesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in\u000a1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of\u000a700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VRoughly half of this year's expected\u000a130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,\u000aa spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the\u000aNetherlands, told Reuters.\u000a    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date\u000afor the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April\u000a23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman\u000aadded.\u000a    "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can\u000aexpect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the\u000acrop is off to a very good start," he said.\u000a    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600\u000ahectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of\u000awhite sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"\u000aand "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.\u000a    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been\u000aintroduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000\u000ahectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000\u000atonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.\u000a    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been\u000aallotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being\u000aboosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VCheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.\u000adollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will\u000apropel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record\u000aprofits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,\u000amajor company executives predicted.\u000a    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an\u000aindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF\u000aCorp <GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms\u000ato aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.\u000a    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH>, the\u000aKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for\u000amoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy.\u000a    "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period," said\u000aPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW>, adding,\u000a"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world\u000anow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving\u000athe old ones."\u000a    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,\u000aautomobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of\u000apaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.\u000a    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about\u000a90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike\u000aproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,\u000amanaging director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand\u000afor some products such as styrene could push profit margins up\u000aby as much as 300 pct, he said.\u000a    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in\u000aHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned\u000alast year and predicted it would have the best year in its\u000ahistory.\u000a    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel\u000aand chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.\u000adollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. "I believe the entire\u000achemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"\u000aOreffice said.\u000a    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical\u000aindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.\u000aLast year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion\u000adlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.\u000a    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical\u000aindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck and\u000aplanning, said Pace's John Dosher.\u000a    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks\u000adramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar\u000awas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost\u000aU.S. chemical exports.\u000a    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has\u000abeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical\u000amanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers\u000ain the early 1980s.\u000a    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers\u000ahave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program\u000ato mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate\u000aunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of\u000afriendly and hostile takeover attempts.\u000a    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\u000aUnion Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs\u000afor Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\u000aand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> \u000ahas divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\u000abusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\u000a    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\u000aheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\u000athe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\u000aethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\u000aare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\u000a    "Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent the\u000apast two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\u000achemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\u000adeteriorated," Dosher said. "But I think they will eventually\u000akill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\u000amarket." Some top chemical executives share the concern.\u000a    "The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\u000acarried away and repeating past mistakes," GAF's Heyman\u000acautioned. "The shift from commodity chemicals may be\u000aill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."\u000a    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the\u000aSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700\u000amln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.\u000a    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout\u000aof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1\u000abillion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants\u000aalong the Texas Gulf Coast.\u000a    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that\u000aare the building blocks of specialty products.\u000a    "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a\u000aglamorous, high-margin business," Cain said, adding that demand\u000ais expected to grow by about three pct annually.\u000a    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\u000achemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for\u000aplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood\u000aand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical\u000abusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided the\u000aU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VStorage problems with Brazil's record\u000agrain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln\u000atonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.\u000a    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,\u000atold Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this\u000ayear's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.\u000a    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in\u000aharvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage\u000aproblems.\u000a    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,\u000atheoretically sufficient for the crop.\u000a    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly\u000adistributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do\u000aSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were\u000aresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.\u000a    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West\u000agrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage\u000acapacity.\u000a    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and\u000amaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains\u000aproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.\u000a    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,\u000athere is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to\u000astoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for\u000astoring loose grain, Brito said.\u000a    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the\u000acrops.\u000a    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop\u000ahas been evident from television reports, which have shown\u000aenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.\u000a Reuter\u000a

Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for\u000aMontreal-based Dominion called the report just "rumors."\u000a    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.\u000a    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of\u000athe story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if\u000aBurlington actually came into play.\u000a    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,\u000aadded credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it\u000awas looking for a takeover in the U.S.\u000a    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills\u000aand has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for\u000aa U.S. acquisition.\u000a    A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer\u000ahas been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies, but\u000awould not say whether Burlington was among them.\u000a    "There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not\u000aunusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the\u000ahousecleaning they've done," said Eileen Gormley of Thomson\u000aMcKinnon.\u000a    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets\u000aand other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs\u000alast year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its\u000aoperations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign\u000acompetition, Gormley said.\u000a    "They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"\u000asaid Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial\u000afabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets\u000aand other fabric to the auto industry.\u000a    "In the past, they just spent and never realized the return\u000aon the outlays they did make," she said.\u000a    "You look at their record over the year, and I think\u000athey're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the\u000apast," Gormley said.\u000a     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up\u000afrom 2.01 dlrs per share.\u000a    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington\u000aat its current levels.\u000a    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends\u000aselling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50\u000adlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings\u000abasis.\u000a    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been\u000aplaced on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.\u000a    "After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people\u000adon't find him very credible anymore," said one arbitrager.\u000a    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing\u000amanagements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if\u000ahe doesn't win the target company.\u000a    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky\u000aStores Inc and Fruehauf Corp.

a(VSenior Japanese officials tomorrow\u000aopen talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch\u000aeffort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide\u000avariety of Japanese electronic exports.\u000a    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of\u000aInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of\u000ameetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael\u000aSmith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.\u000a    The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in\u000aretaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to\u000aend dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and\u000ato open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.\u000a    They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,\u000aincluding television and audio equipment and computers.\u000a    Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little\u000alikelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct\u000aduties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.\u000a    President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27\u000aafter he said that close monitoring of the July 1986\u000aU.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that\u000aJapan was not honoring the agreement.\u000a    In making the annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to\u000athe full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to\u000aprovide American industry with free and fair trade."\u000a    Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's\u000asemiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured\u000athe U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has\u000acomplained about presidential timidity on trade issues.\u000a    Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive\u000atrade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's\u000ainaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last\u000ayear reached 169.8 billion dlrs.\u000a    About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.\u000a    Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to\u000aadhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.\u000a    Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals\u000abut did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.\u000a    He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's\u000adecision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense\u000aof MITI's power to control Japanese traders.\u000a    "The United States has excessive expectations.," he said. To\u000astabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by\u000aexcess inventories since 1985 will take some time."\u000a    He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough\u000ain trying to sell in the Japanese market.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VDutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped\u000ato maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to\u000athe 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite\u000acontinuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts\u000ato extend world penetration.\u000a    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln\u000aguilders, after 265 mln in 1985.\u000a    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's\u000aleading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,\u000asaid sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.\u000a    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,\u000aWhere the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,\u000awhere sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.\u000a    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker\u000aforeign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.\u000a    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the\u000aincrease of its stake in leading Spanish brewery <El Aguila\u000aS.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly\u000ain French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The\u000acompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\u000arestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\u000a    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit\u000anext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\u000aalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\u000a    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\u000aEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\u000ainto the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer\u000amarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "We\u000ahave the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\u000apoint," van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\u000ahad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\u000a    "The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\u000amarket, but how we are to do it," van Schaik said, adding that\u000awhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\u000ataste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\u000aregionalized.\u000a     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\u000aAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\u000aimportant beer growth markets in the long term.\u000a     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\u000amajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\u000ahampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\u000a    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\u000aper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\u000aand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\u000a1986 sales.\u000a    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\u000aof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\u000ahave been looking at other possibilities.\u000a    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\u000athe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\u000ahad sold successfully, Coebergh said.\u000a    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\u000amaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\u000apopular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility, but we could not\u000apossibly achieve the Heineken flavor," Coebergh said.\u000a    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to\u000apenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\u000acontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\u000a    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's\u000amarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that\u000aare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western\u000amoney.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VFinancial analysts say they are\u000apleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal\u000abudget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help\u000aimprove the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.\u000a    The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow\u000ato approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming\u000afiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.\u000a    Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan\u000athat would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next\u000ayear.\u000a        "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is\u000ainfinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little\u000aimpact on the economy and the trade deficit," said Stanley\u000aCollander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.\u000a    "At best, it will have a small positive effect," Collander\u000asaid in an interview.\u000a    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly\u000atold Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way\u000ato help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease\u000asome of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.\u000a    The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade\u000aimbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker\u000ahas warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught\u000awith danger.\u000a    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as\u000aimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign\u000acapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.\u000a    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other\u000amajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of\u000athe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates\u000ashould be stabilized at around current levels.\u000a    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to\u000atake steps to stimulate their economies and the United States\u000aagreed to cut its budget deficit.\u000a    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a\u000away to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is\u000ato reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\u000a    "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else\u000ayou do is going to be counterproductive," Volcker said in recent\u000atestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\u000a    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the\u000agovernment's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit\u000asupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or\u000ato assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United\u000aStates.\u000a    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the\u000acurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.\u000a    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed\u000athat any deficit reduction was better than none.\u000a    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were \u000anot enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it\u000aneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar\u000afrom plunging further in world exchange markets.\u000a    "There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if\u000ayour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the\u000aFed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer\u000ais, it's not enough," Silvia told Reuters.\u000a    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's\u000amost vexing and persistent problems.\u000a    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet\u000alittle indication that this year's figure will be any lower,\u000athough administration officials have predicted it will drop by\u000aabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.\u000a    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep\u000aworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the\u000afederal budget.\u000a    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not\u000aattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for\u000athe 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced\u000abudget law.\u000a    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for\u000anext year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget\u000aCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fall\u000ashort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\u000a    "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the\u000amost you're going to get" out of Congress at the present time,\u000asaid Touche Ross's Collander. "To do something more than that\u000awould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."\u000a    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up\u000ashort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\u000a    "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable\u000areduction level," he explained. "Anything less than that will now\u000alook like a failure to Wall Street."\u000a    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would\u000alower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year\u000abeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting\u000adefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their\u000aanticipated spending levels for next year.\u000a    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of\u000anearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new \u000ataxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VBundesbank board member Claus Koehler\u000acalled on central banks of major industrialised nations to\u000acooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.\u000a    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released\u000ahere, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was\u000aprotectionism and control on capital movements.\u000a    "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market\u000atransactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have\u000athem," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would\u000ahave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\u000ato 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\u000a    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\u000ahad parted company with transactions in goods, services and\u000ainvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\u000adetermined market trends.\u000a    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\u000agrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\u000awould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\u000a    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\u000adifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\u000athose needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\u000amounting economic activity," Koehler said.\u000a    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\u000aCurrent account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\u000agoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.\u000a    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\u000arise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\u000aof European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\u000ato the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\u000amake itself felt compared with the price effect.\u000a    "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\u000afurther than would be necessary to adjust the current account\u000aover the medium term," Koehler said.\u000a    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\u000aonly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\u000aIn Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\u000arise faster than GNP.\u000a    "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said.\u000a    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\u000aprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\u000aan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\u000a    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\u000adifferential would Europe and Japan look for financial\u000ainvestment in the U.S.\u000a    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\u000ahad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\u000ameasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\u000a    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\u000aby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\u000ainterest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\u000aand its substantial impact on exchange rates.\u000a    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\u000aprice stability, economic growth and full employment but also\u000ato tackle international problems like the exchange rate\u000aproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\u000a    A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding\u000aof non-inflationary economic growth in an international\u000amonetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said.\u000a    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\u000anecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\u000ato tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\u000athe next few years and intervention points should not be set,\u000abecause they were only testing points for the market, he said.\u000a    In order to keep the international monetary system free of\u000adisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\u000aalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VJapan's little-known Ministry of Posts and\u000aTelecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force\u000ato be reckoned with, political analysts said.\u000a    MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.\u000aAnd Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of\u000aa lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,\u000athey said.\u000a    "The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of\u000aa key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,"\u000asaid one diplomatic source.\u000a    "They are a potent political force," the diplomatic source\u000asaid.\u000a    But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not\u000aalways help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts\u000asaid.\u000a    "The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not\u000aso internationalized," said Waseda University professor Mitsuru\u000aUchida. "Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world\u000acommunity and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to\u000aface the situation."\u000a    Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with\u000aLondon over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep\u000aa major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in\u000aJapan's lucrative overseas telephone business.\u000a    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival\u000agroups, arguing the market cannot support more than one\u000acompetitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now\u000amonopolizes the business.\u000a    It has also opposed a major management role in the planned\u000amerger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on\u000athe grounds that no such international precedent exists.\u000a    The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has\u000athreatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger\u000aplan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open\u000aits telecommunications market.\u000a    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it\u000asays have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car\u000atelephone and satellite communications market.\u000a    Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the\u000asector it regulates.\u000a    "What has been happening is an important shift in the\u000aeconomy which makes the ministry a very important place," said\u000aJames Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory\u000aService Inc.\u000a    A decision to open the telecommunications industry to\u000acompetition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted\u000arather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.\u000a    "With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto\u000alegal framework," said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell\u000aWhitten.\u000a    Close links with the powerful political faction of the\u000aruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime\u000aMinister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the\u000aanalysts said.\u000a    "Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka\u000afaction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance\u000aof MPT," Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of\u000athe influential political group, he added.\u000a    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to\u000athe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the\u000aPostal Savings System, analysts said.\u000a    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate\u000ainterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial\u000aliberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal\u000aSavings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than\u000abanks, they said.\u000a    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's\u000aobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized\u000athe ministry as feudal.\u000a    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting\u000acompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under its\u000awing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest\u000aprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.\u000a    But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of\u000aits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world\u000aincluding Britain, several analysts said.\u000a    "The United States is really the odd man out," Abegglen said.\u000a"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order\u000ain utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable\u000aview," he said.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VEuropean currency markets reacted quietly\u000ato the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers\u000aranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to\u000asurprise that the markets should have expected so much.\u000a    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies\u000aand traded in a narrow range after the communique, which\u000areaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency\u000astabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.\u000a    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining\u000abroadly entrenched in its current trading range.\u000a    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84\u000amarks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank\u000aAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.\u000a    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range\u000awith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.\u000aMerchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.\u000a    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd\u000ain Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against\u000athe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,\u000apossibly to 140 yen.\u000a    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects\u000aa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.\u000a    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb\u000aunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative\u000asentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank\u000aoperators to test the downside.\u000a    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in\u000aWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour of\u000acurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with\u000aworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the\u000anear term, the traders said.\u000a    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the\u000acommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's\u000adownward trend.\u000a    Traders in several centres said the market would look for\u000afresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to\u000adefend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly\u000aconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\u000aintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."\u000a    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said\u000a"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The\u000aU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.\u000a    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be\u000aunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long\u000aEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825\u000amarks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.\u000a    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said\u000athe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable\u000amarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme\u000avolatility seen in the first few months of this year.\u000a    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the\u000acommunique made clear the leading nations did not want a\u000afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.\u000a    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to\u000a1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre\u000aaccord's supposed currency target range.\u000a    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were\u000aready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."\u000a    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique\u000acontributing to greater stability.\u000a    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big\u000aboost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he\u000aexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks\u000ain the next three months.\u000a    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said\u000athe communique had been in line with realistic expectations and\u000ashould not have produced disappointment.\u000a    "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade\u000apolicies to redress current imbalances are of a different\u000atimescale than currency markets operate on," the source told\u000aReuters, "This is a political process which takes time."\u000a    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in\u000aBasle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on\u000acurrency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent\u000aremedy?" he asked.\u000a    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only\u000athe first in a series and said the market would watch carefully\u000ain the next few weeks for any changes in positions.\u000a    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was\u000anow on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by\u000aJapan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could\u000alead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.\u000a    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in\u000apushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months\u000awhile central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to\u000asupport the Paris accord.\u000a REUTER\u000a

They agreed, however, that further actions will\u000abe essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain\u000aglobal economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances."\u000a    It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling\u000aLiberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the\u000acommunique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" including\u000aan "unprecedented front-end loading of public works\u000aexpenditures."\u000a    The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought\u000atogether ministers and central bank governors of the seven\u000amajor industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West\u000aGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.\u000a    The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment\u000aon cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris\u000awhen they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the\u000athen-current levels.\u000a    In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall\u000aagainst the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by\u000athe Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at\u000aaround postwar lows.\u000a    Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United\u000aStates and European countries for its only modest efforts to\u000aopen its markets to outside competition and to reduce its\u000aexports.\u000a    The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open\u000adomestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not\u000aelaborate.\u000a    It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around\u000acurrent levels their currencies are within ranges broadly\u000aconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\u000aintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VDutch insurer AEGON NV <AEGN.AS>\u000areported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln\u000aguilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits\u000afor 1987.\u000a    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion\u000aguilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its\u000arevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a\u000achange in accounting practice. It added that revenues would\u000ahave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.\u000a    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly\u000adue to its life insurance business.\u000a    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose\u000adespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and\u000ahigher personal risks.\u000a    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage\u000ainsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.\u000a    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and\u000alife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change\u000ain accounting for U.S. Annuities.\u000a    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal\u000ainvestment influences that it should be accounted differently\u000afrom the more traditional insurances.\u000a    This change in accounting practice and another change to\u000aaccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,\u000aresulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln\u000aguilders.\u000a    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits\u000awere slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial\u000acosts for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The\u000aHague.\u000a    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged\u000ain the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial\u000acosts for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.\u000a    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in\u000aMay 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these\u000acosts and made only a small contribution to the group's\u000aprofits.\u000a    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill\u000afor Monumental Corp.\u000a    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December\u000a1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.\u000a  REUTER\u000a

a(VThe yen is likely to start another\u000auneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies\u000abecause the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new,\u000acurrency and bond analysts here said.\u000a    "Is that it? I was expecting something more than that," said\u000aone trader at a major Wall Street securities company.\u000a    Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: "The\u000amarket now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again."\u000a    The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days\u000ajust before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying\u000abearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting\u000aof the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven\u000aindustrialized nations in Washington.\u000a    After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a\u000acommunique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's\u000aview that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent\u000awith economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability\u000ashould be fostered around these levels.\u000a    The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.\u000a    "They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with\u000afundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in line\u000awhen it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?," asked\u000aRepublic's Cohen.\u000a    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled\u000aspeculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are\u000aprepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is\u000astill inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.\u000a    Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the\u000akey psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the\u000aauthorities' permissible range.\u000a    Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would\u000aprobably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop\u000aup the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market\u000aintervention and public comments.\u000a    Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of\u000aJapan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of\u000adollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.\u000a    The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively\u000aselling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Trade\u000adata.

a(VEuropean currency markets reacted quietly\u000ato the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers\u000aranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to\u000asurprise that the markets should have expected so much.\u000a    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies\u000aand traded in a narrow range after the communique, which\u000areaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency\u000astabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.\u000a    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining\u000abroadly entrenched in its current trading range.\u000a    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84\u000amarks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank\u000aAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.\u000a    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range\u000awith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.\u000aMerchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.\u000a    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd\u000ain Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against\u000athe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,\u000apossibly to 140 yen.\u000a    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects\u000aa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.\u000a    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb\u000aunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative\u000asentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank\u000aoperators to test the downside.\u000a    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in\u000aWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour of\u000acurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with\u000aworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the\u000along term, the traders said.\u000a    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the\u000acommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's\u000adownward trend.\u000a    Traders in several centres said the market would look for\u000afresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to\u000adefend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly\u000aconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\u000aintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."\u000a    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said\u000a"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The\u000aU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.\u000a    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be\u000aunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long\u000aEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825\u000amarks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.\u000a    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said\u000athe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable\u000amarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme\u000avolatility seen in the first few months of this year.\u000a    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the\u000acommunique made clear the leading nations did not want a\u000afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.\u000a    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to\u000a1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre\u000aaccord's supposed currency target range.\u000a    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were\u000aready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."\u000a    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique\u000acontributing to greater stability.\u000a    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big\u000aboost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he\u000aexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks\u000ain the next three months.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VIndia's private businessmen say they\u000ahave been placed on an unequal footing in raising money from\u000athe capital market because government companies are wooing\u000ainvestors by issuing more attractive tax-free bonds.\u000a    Stock brokers and bankers polled by Reuters said although\u000aequity shares or debenture issues floated by private firms\u000aprovide a higher return and shorter maturity, they are fast\u000alosing their popular appeal as they are liable to both wealth\u000aand income taxes.\u000a    Brokers said many investors are transferring funds into\u000agovernment company bonds because of their tax-free status and\u000aeasy transferability.\u000a    About 100 private companies have postponed plans to issue\u000aequity shares and debentures in the first quarter of fiscal\u000a1987/88 partly on account of fierce competition from public\u000asector bonds, a merchant banker said.\u000a    They included equity shares and rights issue worth one\u000abillion rupees planned to be issued this month by Tata\u000aFertilisers Ltd, he said, adding the issue has been postponed\u000aindefinitely.\u000a    "The government bonds are making serious inroads on the\u000aprivate sector companies' resources," said R. P. Goenka,\u000apresident of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and\u000aIndustry.\u000a    "The discriminatory tax treatment should be done away with\u000aand equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobilise\u000aresources from the market which is common to both," Goenka said.\u000a    A senior Finance Ministry official said government and\u000aprivate firms were free to compete to raise resources, adding\u000ait was not correct that public sector-issued bonds were\u000apreventing private firms from raising money on the stock\u000amarket.\u000a    "Debentures and equity shares floated by private companies\u000astill account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised in\u000astock exchanges," the ministry official said.\u000a    A spokesman at Bombay stock brokers Batliwala and Karani\u000asaid government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees or\u000aabout 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government and\u000anon-government firms in the domestic capital market in 1986/87.\u000a    The share was 35 to 40 pct of about 36.95 billion rupees\u000amobilised in 1985/86, he said. "To save taxes, commercial banks,\u000amainly foreign banks, and some private companies, are investing\u000atheir surplus funds in the tax free bonds," he said.\u000a    "Individuals who are very well off are also investing in the\u000abonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are going\u000afor equities or debentures floated by private companies on a\u000aselective basis," the spokesman said.\u000a    The maturity period of government company bonds varies\u000abetween seven and 10 years. No wealth or income taxes are\u000apayable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pct\u000ainterest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amount^M\u000aexceeds 7,000 rupees a year.\u000a    Equity shares, the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and\u000a12.5 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by private\u000acompanies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or from\u000athe tax on income earned from them.\u000a    The government bonds are listed as securities but traded on\u000aIndia's four major stock exchanges. They can be sold freely on\u000athe stock market by simple endorsement while debentures can\u000aonly be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.\u000a    Government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom in\u000athe stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal tax\u000aconcessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.\u000a    The National Thermal Power Corp, NTPC, was the first\u000agovernment company to issue the bonds to raise one billion\u000arupees in January last year, breaking the monopoly of private\u000acompanies on the capital market. The seven-year NTPC bond was\u000aoversubscribed three times, brokers said.\u000a    Official figures show bonds floated by government companies\u000ahave been heavily oversubscribed. More state companies have\u000asought the Ministry's permission to issue them in coming\u000amonths.\u000a    NTPC's second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51\u000abillion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by the\u000aFinance Ministry.\u000a    The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupees\u000alast year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month the\u000aIndian Railway Finance Corporation's record susbcription\u000atotalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.\u000a    In most cases, the government has allowed the companies to\u000amaintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.\u000a    Goenka said that government bonds are making it\u000aincreasingly difficult for private companies to launch new\u000aequity or debenture issues. He said the government could at\u000aleast "fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised through\u000asuch bonds by the public sector."\u000a    Merchant bankers said the government is pressing state\u000acompanies to borrow from the public by reducing financial\u000asupport to them.\u000a    To ease its internal debt burden, the government has\u000areduced the budgetary support to development investment in\u000aabout 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in\u000a1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figures\u000ashow.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VThe United States, which has long\u000asought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be\u000asatisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and\u000aallows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement\u000ato stabilize currencies.\u000a    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury\u000aSecretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced\u000ayesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.\u000a    But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial\u000apowers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,\u000athe level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.\u000a    And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far\u000aEast demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that\u000acurrencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the\u000acountries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point\u000adespite intervention by the Bank of Japan.\u000a    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the\u000amovement since Paris was consistent with currency trading\u000aranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.\u000a    "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past\u000aseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the\u000adiscussions in Paris," Miyazawa said yesterday.\u000a    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was\u000aannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of\u000aMiyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's\u000ameetings of leading industrial nations.\u000a    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action\u000a"extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris\u000aAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges\u000abroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.\u000a    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West\u000aGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore\u000arepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to\u000afoster exchange rate stability.\u000a    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central\u000abank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the\u000adollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of\u000aintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent\u000ayears. Monetary sources also said they understood that\u000aSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely\u000asuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement.\u000a    They also said there was a growing feeling among the\u000afinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over\u000amedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term\u000adifferences in past meetings.\u000a    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like\u000athe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of\u000ayesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other\u000acountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.\u000a    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that\u000amajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance\u000abetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's\u000atrade deficit have already taken place.\u000a    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut\u000athe budget deficit even though it is implied in the\u000areafffirmation of Paris.\u000a    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are\u000aessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that\u000areached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.\u000a    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this\u000aweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further\u000asharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose\u000asubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could\u000aundermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.\u000a    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the\u000apolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.\u000a    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany\u000awelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own\u000acurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.\u000a    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak\u000adollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the\u000aJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.\u000a    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making\u000atheir policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian\u000aFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.\u000a    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit\u000ato prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.\u000a    The United States and France, backed by the International\u000aMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a\u000alimited number of economic objectives such as growth,\u000ainflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current\u000aaccount balances.\u000a    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in\u000aconsultations between the countries on whether corrective\u000aaction should be required.\u000a    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives\u000ahas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it\u000aimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.\u000a    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully\u000asounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit\u000acurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.\u000a    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges\u000aof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the\u000arelatively free currency markets of recent years.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VThe global economy is expected to\u000aweaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious\u000apoverty outlook, economic analysts said.\u000a    For finance ministers and central bankers attending this\u000aweek's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund\u000aand World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an\u000aadditional concern.\u000a    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct\u000athis year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.\u000a    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a\u000ameasure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to\u000a2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.\u000a    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,\u000aanother measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0\u000apct from 3.5 pct last year.\u000a    The new figures are considered a major disappointment to\u000athe poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the\u000aindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil\u000aprices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope\u000awith growing mounds of debt.\u000a    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed\u000athe industrial country economies would move up to an annual\u000agrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.\u000a    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some\u000atime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into\u000aan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.\u000a    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier\u000astates for markets for their products as well as financial\u000aassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' \u000aeconomies poses fundamental worries.\u000a    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have\u000aonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,\u000aincluding the key one of exports.\u000a    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,\u000ahas served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it\u000atoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only\u000a2.3 pct, according to the IMF.\u000a    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the\u000aUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to\u000aignite their economies but with little apparent success.\u000a    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and\u000athe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade\u000adeficit.\u000a    Reagan administration officials have been saying that the\u000aimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much\u000aslower than expected.\u000a    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "it has\u000ato be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to\u000awork through to payments flows -- probably at least three years\u000ato get a resonably complete effect."\u000a    The report added, however, "the adjustments may take even\u000amore time on this occasion."\u000aREUTER^M\u000a

The government's perceived need to control inflation by\u000akeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.\u000a    High real interest rates were attracting an influx of\u000aspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting the\u000agovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.\u000a    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,\u000aliquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17\u000apct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a\u000atarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.\u000a    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money\u000arate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from\u000a11.8 at end-1986.\u000a    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to\u000ahold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,\u000awith increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new\u000awage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.\u000a    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish\u000aworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.\u000a    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the\u000astate sector, where the government is trying to impose its five\u000apct wage ceiling.\u000a    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in\u000aSpain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first\u000atwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct\u000aincrease over the corresponding period last year.\u000a    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the\u000apeseta to correct the imbalance.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VLead prices have risen this week against\u000aa background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders\u000asaid.\u000a    Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying\u000aor if labour problems develop in North America, they added.\u000a    London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at\u000aa time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and\u000aprices tending to drift lower.\u000a    This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low\u000alevel of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical\u000ademand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.\u000a    The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be\u000afelt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,\u000astocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders\u000asaid.\u000a    The lower supply levels result from a number of different\u000afactors around the globe.\u000a    Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries\u000abecause of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish\u000aexports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at\u000aLinares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant\u000aadditional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have\u000abeen drawing on LME stocks.\u000a    In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,\u000aSouth Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks\u000afor maintenance. Although the company said it would meet\u000acommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.\u000a    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes\u000aper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks\u000aand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the\u000aU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and\u000aa regular supplier to the world market.\u000a    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,\u000ahave been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.\u000a    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up\u000aquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported\u000ain the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the\u000afirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying\u000aorder was filled by merchants in March.\u000a    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices\u000athis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and\u000aestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three months\u000adelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in\u000aGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often\u000aa target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.\u000a    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp\u000aand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,\u000aand this is believed to be in strong hands.\u000a    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest\u000alevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses\u000awhich are not popular with merchants putting together\u000ashipments.\u000a    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since\u000athe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to\u000asecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies\u000aaffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on\u000athe transport of used batteries.\u000a    Labour negotiations in North America will play an important\u000apart in determining the direction of prices, with contracts\u000aexpiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,\u000aMine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.\u000a    Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract\u000aexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of\u000astrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.\u000a    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting\u000aspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current\u000afirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium\u000ato 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at\u000amidsession.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VLosses for Volkswagen AG\u000a<VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will\u000anot exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW\u000aspokesman said.\u000a    The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it\u000awould pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on\u000a1986 business, despite the provision.\u000a    One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency\u000adealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from\u000athe currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but\u000athe VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."\u000a    VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board\u000ameeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in\u000adetail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign\u000acurrency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing\u000acompany.\u000a    VW has said computer programs were erased and documents\u000awere faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes\u000atransactions intended to protect it against possible foreign\u000acurrency losses were not completed.\u000a    VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was\u000aarrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having\u000aevaded justice.\u000a    Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985\u000aprofits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and\u000aparent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend\u000aan unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has\u000aalso set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,\u000awhich were issued last year. Analysts have described the held\u000adividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.\u000a    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5\u000abillion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment\u000aon 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,\u000asince the new capital was in preference shares.\u000a    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in\u000aorder to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At\u000athe end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly\u000aless than three billion marks.\u000a REUTER\u000a

The important thing is that it\u000acontinue year after year," Lawson said.\u000a    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to\u000astabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six\u000aweeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against\u000athe dollar despite massive central bank intervention.\u000a    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in\u000athe Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had been\u000ano intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."\u000a    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson\u000asaid, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode\u000a... but one has to be vigilant."\u000a    He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that\u000a"current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been\u000a"carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean the\u000asame thing," he said.\u000a    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese\u000ameasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of\u000aweakness for that agreement.\u000a    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's\u000apresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate\u000adomestic demand.\u000a    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate\u000aincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the package\u000aalso involved a second stage to increase expenditures during\u000athe second half of this year.\u000a Reuter\u000a

April futures traded this\u000amorning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB's\u000aaverage price of 104 stg.\u000a    Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is\u000aa two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said quality\u000apotatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying\u000abetween 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesser\u000aquality grades have traded below 100 stg.\u000a    Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered\u000aagainst the April futures contract between now and the end of\u000athe month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.\u000a    Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management\u000acommittee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice\u000aand he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VSteel stocks, which have had a healthy\u000arunup recently, still present some short term investment\u000aopportunities, according to some steel analysts.\u000a    But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm\u000aprices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end\u000asoon. They recommend taking profits.\u000a    "It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal," said\u000aCharles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. "Orders will be\u000astrong for about two months, and there are signs that some\u000a(order rates) are starting to dive already."\u000a    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees\u000asome short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp\u000a<X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp <BS>, Armco Inc <AS> and Inland Steel\u000aIndustries Inc <IAD>.\u000a    "There is still some attractiveness to steels over the\u000ashort- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and\u000arising prices," Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,\u000ahowever, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to\u000amake them more efficient.\u000a    Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to\u000arecommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.\u000a    Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance\u000asheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business\u000ahas been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford\u000anoted. "It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but\u000athey've come a long way," he said.\u000a    "We think the stock will do moderately better than the\u000amarket," he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,\u000acould go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.\u000a    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,\u000abefore special gains from recouped investment tax credits,\u000aagainst losses last year.\u000a    Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he\u000asaid.\u000a    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. "We had a buy\u000aon it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have\u000ait," he said.\u000a    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a\u000ashare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and\u000afrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. "But a lot\u000adepends on oil prices," he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales\u000acome from oil and natural gas.\u000a    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of\u000aSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. "The company's done a lot\u000a(of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit\u000afor," she said.\u000a    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was\u000atrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a\u000ashare this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in\u000a1986.\u000a    Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has\u000abeen recommending the stocks since last November.\u000a    Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group\u000aalthough he said the earnings outlook is improved through the\u000athird quarter.\u000a    But he sees potential trouble beyond then. "I think (steel)\u000aprices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,"\u000ahe said.\u000a    Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal\u000adropoff later in the year. "But there are more positives than\u000anegatives," she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic\u000aindustry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should\u000acause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VU.S. retailers' lackluster March sales\u000awere due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a\u000arecovery in April.\u000a    "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but\u000aunderlying business is better than the numbers indicate," said\u000aBear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.\u000a     Analysts generally average the sales results of March and\u000aApril to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This\u000ayear, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three\u000aweeks later than last year.\u000a    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said\u000asales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a\u000aseasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted\u000a5.7 pct last year.\u000a    "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate\u000athat the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear\u000ato be because liquidity and employment are rising," said\u000aanalyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.\u000a    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in\u000aaccording to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected\u000ato rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.\u000a     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket\u000aitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many\u000aanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the\u000aholiday nears.\u000a    "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a\u000acontinuing strength in the housing market," said Edward\u000aBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co <S> which reported an\u000aoverall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's\u000asportswear were also excellent.\u000a    "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even\u000aa modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment\u000adue to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"\u000asaid C.J.

Penney Co Inc <JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp <DH> were\u000aamong the weaker performers with comparable stores sales\u000adeclining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and\u000acatalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's\u000aoverall sales rose 4.8 pct.\u000a    Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continued\u000astrong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from\u000avery active in the east to weak in the economically depressed\u000asouthwest."\u000a    "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity\u000awear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,\u000abut are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of Bear\u000aStearns.\u000a    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for\u000athe decline.

a(VEurodollar bonds closed as much as a full\u000apoint lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against the\u000ayen and interest rates on U.S. Treasuries rose almost to eight\u000apct.\u000a    The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightly\u000aafter foreign exchange traders in New York said the Federal\u000aReserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.\u000a    But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank,\u000awholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs in\u000aa seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.\u000a    Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal,\u000aat the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points over\u000acomparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close of\u000atrading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide\u000ain aftermarket activity.\u000a    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for a\u000anewly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.\u000aFor example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrs\u000aat only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said that\u000abecause the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the\u000alast time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.\u000a    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intended\u000ato compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty\u000acurrently associated with owning dollar securities.\u000a    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in\u000adollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the\u000aonly market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.\u000aJapan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.\u000a    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into\u000ayen as the borrowers previous issues were.\u000a    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees\u000aat less 1.75 less 1.55.\u000a    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from\u000aToshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8\u000apct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.\u000a    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,\u000athe largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by Sekisui\u000aChemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue has\u000aequity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted on\u000abrokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.\u000a    The Australian dollar market continued active, with\u000aCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mln\u000afive-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.\u000a    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. A\u000asimilar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightly\u000ahigher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was\u000aquoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.\u000a    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing to\u000aaccept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less\u000athan annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail\u000abuyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates\u000afall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential for\u000acapital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are also\u000abetter for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.\u000a    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds are\u000aapparently being placed with retail accounts on the European\u000acontinent with very little placement being done in Japan.\u000a    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on\u000adomestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as\u000athe yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to\u000a144 yen.\u000a    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyen\u000aissue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the second\u000aseven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curve\u000ain Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VSwiss franc notes issued after May 1 must\u000abe provided with a prospectus, virtually erasing the difference\u000ain information requirements between notes and public bonds,\u000aaccording to a convention drafted by the Bankers' Federation.\u000a    The convention requires that lead managers draw up a\u000aprospectus naming all syndicate members and providing certain\u000adetails about the borrower.\u000a    In contrast to public issues, though, the prospectus must\u000amerely be made available to clients on request via all\u000asyndicate banks rather than published and distributed in\u000aprinted form.\u000a    The convention, which was approved by banks earlier this\u000amonth, replaces an earlier convention dating from 1984 and\u000adeals with what had been widely seen as an increasingly\u000aanachronistic distinction between notes and public issues.\u000a    Its publication follows a long debate among bankers on the\u000aamount of information that should be provided by borrowers,\u000aheightened by difficulties with Swiss franc issues here on\u000arecent occasions .\u000a    It applies to all notes in units of at least 50,000 Swiss\u000afrancs, the usual denomination, which are placed directly with\u000acustomers by the syndicate and not quoted on the bourse.\u000a    Anything smaller than 50,000 francs will be governed by the\u000aunchanged, more demanding rules that apply to public issues.\u000a    Bankers contacted by Reuters said they did not envisage\u000athat the new requirement would present them with problems or\u000apush up fees. Many banks said that they had for some time been\u000aproviding more than the legal minimum of information.\u000a    Traditionally, notes or private placements, as they were\u000aalso known, were medium term instruments denominated in 50,000\u000afrancs and placed largely with institutional investors.\u000a    They were normally not brought onto the open market and\u000anever quoted on the stock exchange.\u000a    But over the years the distinction between notes and the\u000apublicly quoted and traded bonds gradually broke down. The\u000aNational Bank therefore last May abolished all remaining\u000arestrictions on maturities and denominations which still\u000aformally divided them.\u000a    However, it was not in the competence of the National Bank\u000ato rule on prospectuses and banks have since continued largely\u000aas before: public issues, generally quoted on stock exchanges,\u000ahave been provided with detailed prospectuses, while notes,\u000avirtually always not-quoted, have been equipped only with\u000a"information memorandums" with varying degrees of detail.\u000a    The new convention attempts to put an end to this. It says\u000aeach notes prospectus must contain the following seven points:\u000a    - The precise terms of the issue\u000a    - Details of the company performance if it is more than six\u000amonths since the last annual report\u000a    - Naming of all guarantors\u000a    - The source of the information\u000a    - Details of ratings, insofar as they have been made\u000a    - For equity linked notes, details of where the company's\u000ashares are listed and price high and lows over at least the\u000alast three years.\u000a    - That the lead manager has required the borrower to\u000aprovide information during the lifetime of the notes on the\u000aprogress of his business.\u000a     According to figures from Swiss Bank Corp, total note\u000aissues by foreign borrowers reached 18.6 billion Swiss francs\u000alast year, compared with 23.6 billion francs borrowed in the\u000aform of public bonds.\u000a    A majority of the note issues were for Japanese borrowers.\u000a REUTER\u000a

Normally\u000awhen an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of\u000abeef exports," one industry source said yesterday.\u000a     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, "Depending on the\u000aseriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then\u000adecides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting\u000abeef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension\u000aon exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are\u000astill awaiting their decision," he added, asking not to be\u000aidentified.\u000a    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of\u000ahigh-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had\u000aspent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and\u000aupgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.\u000a    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be\u000aforced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low\u000aprices, the source said.

Nivison and Co.\u000a    The debentures are due June 1, 2002 and pay a semi-annual\u000acoupon of two pct and are priced at par. They can be converted\u000ainto shares of the company's stock at 23-1/2 dlrs a share.\u000a    IRT's shares closed last night on the New York Stock\u000aExchange at 19-7/8.\u000a    The debentures can be redeemed at par at maturity and are\u000acallable at the company's option after the first two years.\u000a    On or after August 1989 the company can call half the\u000adebentures if the stock trades for 30 days at 123 pct of the\u000aconversion price and half if it reaches 140 pct of the\u000aconversion price, Nivison said.\u000a    In addition, holders will be able to surrender half the\u000abonds during May 1991 at 123 pct for a semi-annual yield of\u000a7.043 pct and the other half in May 1993 at 140 pct, for a\u000ayield of 7.383 pct.\u000a    The payment date is June 1, 1987.

a(VCanada's trade picture has brightened\u000aconsiderably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector\u000awould post a long awaited recovery this year.\u000a    The federal government reported today that the monthly\u000asurplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,\u000adouble January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than\u000aFebruary 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.\u000a    "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said Richardson\u000aGreenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.\u000a    Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the\u000anext months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the\u000ayear.\u000a    "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the\u000ayear, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is\u000aindicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at the\u000aToronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.\u000a    Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23\u000apct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion\u000adls in the month.\u000a    "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of\u000aexports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in its\u000amonthly report.\u000a    Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85\u000abillion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion\u000adlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.\u000a    Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end\u000aup three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal\u000a10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion\u000adlrs.\u000a    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched\u000aoff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85\u000aU.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after\u000aclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.\u000a    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early\u000aafternoon trading.\u000a    Economists have been banking on an improved trade\u000aperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish\u000aCanadian economy.\u000a    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched\u000aoff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85\u000aU.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after\u000aclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.\u000a    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early\u000aafternoon trading.\u000a    Economists have been banking on an improved trade\u000aperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish\u000aCanadian economy.\u000a    They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at\u000aa torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays\u000athis year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into\u000athe country.\u000a    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United\u000aStates, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be\u000astrong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer\u000aspending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.\u000a    "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export\u000aperformance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland's\u000aDonegan.\u000a    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist\u000aWarren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and\u000asaid it could be a mistake to read too much into February's\u000atrade upturn.\u000a    Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing\u000asigns of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate\u000athat part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is\u000aprobably transitory."\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VThe House Armed Services Committee\u000ahas voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled\u000amaterials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.\u000a    The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and\u000aquality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.\u000a    The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill\u000awhich will be voted on in the House next month.\u000a    The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee\u000ayesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage\u000asell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a\u000astaff member of the committee told Reuters.\u000a    "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being\u000amanaged properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpile\u000aover the last 10 years has been atrocious."\u000a    Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a\u000aWhite House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\u000a    The staffer said that under the measures passed by the\u000acommittee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence\u000aover decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.\u000a    The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs\u000aworth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The\u000astockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.\u000a    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage\u000athe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.\u000a    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget\u000aand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.\u000a    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile\u000amanagement was counter-productive, he said.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VThe United States' dependency on\u000aforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,\u000aaccording to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry\u000aResearch Associates.\u000a    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference\u000ahere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much\u000aas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high\u000alevel of 47 pct in 1977.\u000a    "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is\u000ainevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil\u000aimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.\u000a    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for\u000a33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to\u000a40 pct by 1990.\u000a    "However, the rate of this growth can be affected\u000apositively or negatively through government action or\u000ainaction," Lichtblau said.\u000a    He said that one of the government's negative actions is\u000athe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a\u000adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash\u000aflow for oil exploration.\u000a    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor\u000aprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.\u000a    "An international floor price adopted by all or most\u000aindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effective\u000ameasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if\u000awe imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.\u000a    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic\u000afuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen\u000aU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.\u000a    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the\u000awillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.\u000a    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer\u000atax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic\u000aPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans\u000afor alternative energy.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VCommodities from gold to grains to\u000acotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses\u000ain the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of\u000ainflation and economic instability.\u000a    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New\u000aYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a\u000atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.\u000a    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that\u000ainflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations\u000ato halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve\u000aChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,\u000aHarris Upham and Co., in New York.\u000a    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from\u000athe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their\u000acommitment to support its value, and despite reports of\u000aintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.\u000a    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known\u000aas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term\u000adirection of the currency markets.\u000a    "Maybe they have some ideas or plans," said Chronowitz. "If\u000athey do, it's not evident."\u000a    "It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market\u000atake values to where they should be.\u000a    "One way or another, we will force our major trading\u000apartners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correct\u000athe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.\u000a    "I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long\u000atime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's\u000agoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's\u000ahappening," he said.\u000a    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities\u000acheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.\u000a    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds\u000asaw the value of their investments falling and many are turning\u000ato commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty\u000aMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of\u000aDominick and Dominick.\u000a    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout\u000athe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton\u000aposted broad gains.\u000a    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the\u000agrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome\u000asupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate\u000aexport demand.\u000a    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department\u000araised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by\u000atwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.\u000a    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the\u000aChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately\u000ahigher.\u000a    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said\u000ahogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at\u000athis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field\u000awork to market animals.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VEconomists said that they doubt the\u000aFederal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite\u000ahigher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week\u000astatement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.\u000a    Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged\u000a393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln\u000adlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were\u000a1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.\u000a    "One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it\u000aprobably isn't," said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.\u000a    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy\u000amodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the\u000atwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging\u000aaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.\u000a    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest\u000atwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand\u000aoften pushes up borrrowings.\u000a    "Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it\u000alooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions\u000alate in the statement period and didn't quite make it," said\u000aWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\u000a    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that\u000athe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or\u000amore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.\u000a    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in\u000aits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer\u000areserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.\u000a    The Fed took no market reserve management action last\u000aThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added\u000atemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of\u000acustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves\u000adirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.\u000a    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the\u000atwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on\u000aTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's\u000aovernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.\u000a    "It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at\u000athis time," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.\u000a    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi\u000asaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest\u000arates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak\u000aeconomies in the United States and abroad and add to the\u000afinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders.\u000a    "Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest\u000astatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar\u000atumbled," said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.\u000a    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new\u000astatement period began today on disappointment yesterday's\u000aWashington meetings of international monetary officials failed\u000ato produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.\u000a    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in\u000aWednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that\u000athe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade\u000aimbalance between the United States and Japan.\u000a    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for\u000asteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average\u000aFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where\u000athe rate has been since early November.\u000a    "I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter\u000apolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect," said Sullivan of\u000aDean Witter.\u000a    If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just\u000anudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from\u000asix to 6.10 pct previously.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VToday's turmoil in the U.S. Financial\u000amarkets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's\u000awake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that\u000ais likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.\u000a    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline\u000aas the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell\u000asharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.\u000a    But that confidence is now cracking as the financial\u000amarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's\u000aoften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\u000a    "Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar\u000afreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it," said\u000aDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\u000a    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\u000a40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\u000afailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\u000acredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\u000aof further depreciation of the dollar.\u000a    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\u000aworries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare\u000aaway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\u000a    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\u000adlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\u000ain interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\u000aby 33 points to 2339.\u000a    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\u000amarkets' instability frightening. He believes economic\u000afundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that "once\u000ayou start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop."\u000a    "There's a stark possibility that you could get a\u000adestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\u000aand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic."\u000a    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\u000ain Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\u000acontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\u000a264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\u000a    "We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\u000athe agony may be fairly drawn out," Marris told Reuters.\u000a    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\u000ayear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\u000awould take very little to touch off what he calls the second\u000aphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\u000adollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\u000a    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on\u000aMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\u000a    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\u000ahistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\u000anot affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\u000adecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\u000a    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest\u000aweakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\u000asuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\u000abelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\u000apart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\u000a    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\u000aconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\u000aplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\u000aimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\u000a    Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\u000areturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\u000aaddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\u000amassive budget deficit.\u000a    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\u000acentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\u000achoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\u000a    "The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\u000asubstantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\u000acut abroad, at least by Japan," said Lanston's Jones.\u000a    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\u000arates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\u000aAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others.\u000a    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\u000aCo, scoffed at the notion. "It's ridiculous to think the Federal\u000aReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\u000aagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\u000aweakness," he said.\u000a    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\u000amade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\u000a    "We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\u000abudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\u000acares," he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\u000awill have been greater.\u000a    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\u000athinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\u000a    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\u000aa further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. "Put on\u000ayour helmets," Giordano said.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VWest Germany's capital market\u000aliberalization program has stalled and bankers are worried it\u000amay take years for further reforms to be completed.\u000a    Liberalization got underway in May 1985 when foreign banks\u000areceived Bundesbank permission to lead-manage mark eurobonds.\u000a    Further moves included introduction of mark-denominated\u000acertificates of deposit last year. But other changes, including\u000arevisions in the domestic options market and introduction of\u000afutures contracts, need lengthy statutory changes and this may\u000atake years, bankers and dealers say.\u000a    Deutsche Bank AG co-chairman F. Wilhelm Christians called\u000alast week for an enlargement of current capital market\u000ainstruments to include instruments already standard abroad.\u000a    He said these are needed especially when prices fall,\u000aciting declines in West German share prices in the first two\u000amonths of this year when stock indices fell about 20 pct.\u000a    Others are more blunt. Securities dealers say the lack of\u000aviable hedging instruments for shares and bonds makes trading\u000ain domestic markets too risky.\u000a    "We need a stock index futures contract, and a futures\u000acontract for recent government bonds," one dealer said.\u000a    West Germany now has options contracts on about five pct of\u000ashares and bonds traded on exchanges here, covering only about\u000a30 pct of the average traded volume, stock market sources said.\u000a    Options can only be written on the original 14 bonds\u000aselected when bond options were introduced last April. The most\u000arecent bond on the list was issued in 1985.\u000a    There are no futures exchanges in West Germany. German\u000abanks may participate in futures exchanges through branches\u000aabroad but these are at least outwardly subject to stringent\u000aWest German rules requiring that every contract be secured on a\u000aone-by-one basis with a separate hedge, to prevent speculation.\u000a    Another problem is a lack of liquidity in the existing\u000amarkets, owing to lack of private investor participation.\u000a    Private individuals and corporations do not engage in\u000aoptions trading now due to West Germany's civil and exchange\u000alaws, which define losses made in futures and options business\u000aas gambling losses, which investors need not pay back.\u000a    Options business has been hurt by lack of liquidity from\u000apension funds, which currently are forbidden to invest in these\u000ainstruments. But they are to be allowed to enter the business\u000asoon as the European Community begins to harmonize rules\u000agoverning funds.\u000a    Manfred Laux, general secretary of the West German mutual\u000afunds association in Frankfurt, said harmonized rules are to be\u000aadopted by October 1, 1989 at the latest.\u000a    The push to adopt new instruments has not been great in the\u000apast, owing to wide-spread belief they are speculative, which\u000agives them a bad name in West Germany. But pressure for their\u000aintroduction here is growing.\u000a    The start-up of a Swiss futures exchange has some bankers\u000aconsidering if a similar exchange would be useful in West\u000aGermany. They say that without innovations, some business could\u000adrift to London, which the Bundesbank vehemently opposes.\u000a    An official at the London International Financial Futures\u000aExchange (LIFFE) said the exchange currently has no plans to\u000aintroduce more mark-denominated contracts beyond the existing\u000amark-dollar contract. But he said the exchange is studying the\u000afeasibility of other contracts, including one for three-month\u000amark interest rates and possibly a government bond contract.\u000a    A Bundesbank capital markets expert said the Bundesbank has\u000ano objections to hedging through futures but any liberalization\u000ain that sector is still in the early planning stages after\u000aearlier talks ended two years ago.\u000a    Considerations about the futures business have been drawn\u000aout because of the large number of participants involved in\u000atalks. They include parliament, the Bundesbank, the Federal\u000aBanking Supervisory Board, eight West German stock exchanges\u000aand their governing states, and the four West German banking\u000aassociations.\u000a    Beyond options and futures, other changes being suggested\u000ainclude replacing the federal government's current bond\u000aconsortium with an auction procedure similar to one being\u000aconsidered in the U.K. And already in practice in the U.S.\u000a    This would upset the existing market order providing German\u000aand foreign banks in the consortium with fixed quotas but it\u000awould eliminate the misallocations some bankers say presently\u000aarise within the fixed consortium quota system.\u000a    In addition, some bankers would like the method of bond\u000atrading on the West German stock exchange changed to a system\u000aof continuous price-setting from the current system in which\u000aevery bond price is fixed once a day.\u000a    This would make trading more transparent if it reduced the\u000aproportion of off-floor interbank bond trading, now some 90 pct\u000aof the volume of bond transactions here, the bankers say.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VMember states of the European\u000aCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan which\u000athey believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open\u000aits market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.\u000a    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC\u000acountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the\u000awillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese\u000agovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.\u000a    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as\u000aEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.\u000a    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to\u000aan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could\u000araise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.\u000aCarries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.\u000a    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations\u000aentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed\u000ato stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of\u000athe U.S.\u000a    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's\u000atrade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in\u000aMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February.\u000a    In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion\u000adlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one\u000apct to 12.43 billion dlrs.\u000a    In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has\u000adecided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.\u000a    Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen\u000aCoquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application\u000aof French quality standards -- something EC states say often\u000ahappens to their own exports entering Japan.\u000a    Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese\u000abanks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,\u000abecause the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in\u000acompetition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.\u000a    However, British officials in London have said that the\u000agovernment may have gone too far in implying that it would take\u000aimmediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.\u000a    By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful\u000aeconomy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring\u000ato rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own\u000aindustries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.\u000a    The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent\u000ayears, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open\u000aits market with specific demands for moves in key areas.\u000a    At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end\u000aallegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and\u000aspirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts\u000afor the building of a new international airport, and to\u000asimplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.\u000a    EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but\u000aoften the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff\u000abarriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.\u000a    They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the\u000aEC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.\u000a    One of the problems Britain could face if it were to\u000awithdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers\u000awould be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,\u000athey point out.\u000a REUTER\u000a

Wheat sowing normally begins in May.\u000a    However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be\u000acut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were\u000afacing enormous financial pressures.\u000a    He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln\u000ahectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about\u000a16 mln tonnes.

a(VEuro-medium term notes, a recent\u000aphenomenon in the international capital markets, are hardly\u000aattracting a flood of issuers but investment bankers are doing\u000atheir best to breath life into the market.\u000a    Medium term notes (MTNs) have met with staggering success\u000ain the U.S. Market where total outstandings have grown to\u000aaround 50 billion dlrs since 1983, the year they took hold as a\u000anew financing vehicle to bridge the gap between commercial\u000apaper and longer term bonds. Convinced they are here to stay,\u000ainvestment bankers are attempting to adapt MTNs for the\u000aeuromarket.\u000a    Ralph Bunche, a vice president of Morgan Stanley\u000aInternational, predicted at a recent Euromoney conference on\u000aMTNs here that they will become the predominant instrument for\u000araising funds in the late 1980's and 1990's. "It (the MTN\u000amarket) will even surpass the bond market," he said.\u000a    Other bankers took exception with the degree to which MTNs\u000awill grow. But they generally agreed that these instruments\u000aprovide the borrower with greater flexibility and lower costs\u000athan a traditional bond.\u000a    The trick is in convincing European borrowers it is worth\u000aarranging a program and, having accomplished that, to persaude\u000aEuropean investors -- whose preferences differ from their U.S.\u000aCounterparts -- to buy the securities.\u000a    Discussions with bankers proved one thing. No one is\u000aexactly sure how to proceed with structuring and marketing\u000athese issues.\u000a    To date only 13 Euro-MTN programs have been announced but\u000aonly a few have been activated, such as those for a unit of\u000aPepsiCo Inc and another for AB Electrolux.\u000a    Several firms have devised different structures for\u000aEuro-MTNs and defend their structures adamantly.\u000a    The PepsiCo notes, for example, are sold on a continuously\u000aoffered basis. This involves a small amount of new notes with\u000asimilar maturities constantly on offer at current market rates.\u000a    The Electrolux program uses multi-tranche tap notes devised\u000aby Merrill Lynch. Under this structure, an initial tranche of a\u000aminimum 50 mln dlrs has a fixed rate of interest and maturity.\u000aThe borrower then issues additional notes in this category up\u000ato a pre-determined maximum.\u000a    Those who defend the continuously offered method, such as\u000aWendy Dietze, a Salomon Brothers Inc vice president, point to\u000athe flexibility they offer in interest rate and maturity.\u000a    Furthermore, she believes this structure offers the\u000aEuropean investor greater confidence in market liquidity -- a\u000amajor concern for these buyers.\u000a    Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd's Kevin Regan defends the\u000amedium-tranche tap notes concept saying it offers comparable\u000aliquidity. But he also said that this structure may not be the\u000aright option for all borrowers.\u000a    Peter Mortimer, a partner in the law firm Milbank, Tweed,\u000aHadley and McCloy, noted that legal requirements could well\u000adetermine which structure is chosen.\u000a    He noted that the tap system allows a more clearly defined\u000a"lock-up" period as each tranche has a specific maturity. In the\u000acase of notes issued by U.S. Borrowers, the "lock-up" period is\u000athe 90 days after the completion of a series during which time\u000aa security cannot be sold back to the U.S. Or to U.S.\u000aInvestors.\u000a    However, he said that the Securities and Exchange\u000aCommission is reviewing its current regulations on the\u000aownership of foreign securities by U.S. Citizens and that some\u000asoftening in the rules could come in the not too distant\u000afuture.\u000a    For their part borrowers say they feel a bit like guinea\u000apigs.\u000a    Petter Skouen, executive vice president of the Nordic\u000aInvestment Bank (NIB), noted that a few weeks ago NIB would\u000ahave said it was disappointed with its Euro-MTN program, but\u000athat the success of a recent issue changed their minds.\u000a    He conceded that in retrospect it would have been wiser to\u000aestablish separate programs for the euromarket and the U.S.\u000aDomestic market, rather than try to extend the U.S. Issue\u000aglobally.

The five institutes had jointly forecast\u000athree pct 1987 growth in October last year.\u000a    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin\u000aand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.\u000a    The joint report said that the estimates of economic\u000adevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were "markedly less\u000afavourable" than those of the other three.\u000a    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a\u000aslow start to the year. "In the second half of 1987 there will,\u000ahowever, only be a weak upward movement," they said.\u000a    The two institutes said external economic factors which\u000awere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would\u000adominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw\u000aexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no\u000amarked improvement in the course of the year.\u000a    The other three institutes, however, wrote: "The decline in\u000ademand and production (seen) in the winter months does not\u000aindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing."\u000a    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate\u000auncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.\u000aBut they expected that many investments had not been cancelled\u000abut only put off. "It can be presumed that the braking actions\u000a(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year."\u000a    They added: "The domestic prerequisites for a continuation\u000aof the economic uptrend are still favourable."\u000a    These three institutes said diminishing external burdens\u000acombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in\u000ademand and production could be expected by the spring.\u000a    However, this projection was clouded by risks including the\u000afurther development of the mark against the dollar.\u000a    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that\u000awhile exports would continue to be the weak point of the\u000aeconomy in 1987, "there is good reason to believe that exports\u000awill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during\u000athe course of the year." They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall\u000ain exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.\u000a    The three more positive institutes saw private consumption\u000arising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,\u000awhile DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.\u000a    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but\u000apredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in\u000a1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.\u000a    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in\u000aunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the\u000ajobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23\u000amln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in\u000awork of about 200,000.\u000a    These three institutes said new jobs would be created\u000amainly in the private services sector and also by the state in\u000athe context of job creation measures. The construction industry\u000awas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980\u000abut they predicted either no rise in employment in the\u000amanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.\u000a    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only\u000ain the tertiary sector, while "the number employed in the\u000amanufacturing industry will decline."\u000a    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to\u000a2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.\u000a    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58\u000abillion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a\u000acurrent account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks\u000aand predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around\u000a100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.\u000a    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to\u000arise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five\u000apredicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.\u000a REUTER\u000a

Gross national\u000aproduct grew 2.4 pct last year.\u000a    But the report said all the institutes believed that "more\u000amust be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional\u000ajobs can be created."\u000a    The institutes said any step which improved basic economic\u000aconditions should be taken as quickly as possible. "From this\u000apoint of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be\u000abrought forward."\u000a    The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion\u000amarks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from\u000athe tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.\u000a    However, the institutes criticised the government, not only\u000afor the timing of the reform, but also because the question of\u000aits financing had been left open.\u000a    The government has not specified how the remaining 19\u000abillion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,\u000athough it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.\u000a    The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had\u000acaused uncertainty among companies and households as to what\u000aexactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a\u000aquick decision from the government.\u000a    They also said the government should reduce tax\u000apreferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a\u000arestriction of state spending and called for no increase in\u000avalue-added tax.\u000a    The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing\u000asubsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.\u000a    They referred specifically to a doubling of special\u000awritedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a\u000apackage of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this\u000aas an increase in subsidies.\u000a    The institutes said total subsidies, including tax\u000apreferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen\u000afurther since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it\u000ashould be possible "despite ... Major political difficulties" to\u000afinance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.\u000a    The institutes said that if the government raised value\u000aadded tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the\u000apositive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.\u000a    The report also noted that the government was progressing\u000aonly slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and\u000asaid more deregulation was needed.

a(VTop officials of leading industrial\u000anations appear deeply worried that financial markets have\u000aignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which they\u000abelieve they strengthened in talks last week.\u000a    Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the\u000amarkets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely\u000adisrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the\u000apolicy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,\u000aJapan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.\u000a    Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to\u000areassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a\u000astatement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur\u000aunderscored that by saying: "I don't believe at all that the\u000aAmericans want a weaker dollar."\u000a    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the\u000adollar's latest rapid descent "involves the risk -- now already\u000aa tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,\u000aleading to a renewed rise in interest rates."\u000a    But there were signs too, that while policymakers feared\u000athe market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they\u000acould do until the economic picture changed, and currencies\u000asettled into a stable pattern as a result.\u000a    Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's\u000asemi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher\u000aU.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid\u000adescent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.\u000a    Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told\u000atelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of driving\u000athe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.\u000a    "It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would\u000aadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would\u000adrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not\u000a(into) recession, into slower growth," he said.\u000a    Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the\u000adollar, Balladur said: "When a currency is maintained\u000aartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is\u000anot healthy."\u000a    And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to\u000arecession, he said.\u000a    Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of\u000alife, Balladur said, "there may be adjustments of course in one\u000aor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system."\u000a    But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he\u000amight rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.\u000a    U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it\u000aunderstood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.\u000a    "The United States and the six major industrial countries\u000aare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these\u000aagreements," Baker told the meetings.\u000a    Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which\u000awrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further\u000adecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to\u000astabilizing currencies at current levels.\u000a    Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February\u000a22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed\u000ato reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight\u000aprotectionism.\u000a    West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate\u000adomestic demand and lead a global upturn.\u000a    Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's\u000apromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.\u000a    The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major\u000aaction. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable\u000acurrencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at\u000athe time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.\u000a    The Paris accord said, "currencies (are) within ranges\u000abroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given\u000athe policy commitments summarized in this statement."\u000a    Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially\u000aagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent\u000awith the agreement. "The ministers and governors reaffirmed the\u000aview that around current levels their currencies are within\u000aranges broadly consistent with fundamentals," last week's\u000astatement read.\u000a    Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were\u000afocusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.\u000aTrade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan\u000arather than prospective policy changes.

The offer had\u000abeen scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he\u000ahad received a "negligible" number of shares in response to the\u000aoffer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.\u000a    Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln\u000acommon shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a\u000aprimary basis.\u000a    Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan\u000aas an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders\u000awould receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject\u000ato approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in\u000aJune.\u000a    The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln\u000adlrs in debt to finance the payout.\u000a    Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the\u000aamended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to\u000agive him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on\u000athe arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New\u000aJersey and Nevada gaming authorities.\u000a    He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all\u000aof Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a\u000amerger transaction.\u000a    Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares\u000ahe is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,\u000awould give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.\u000a    He said he still has received only a "negligible" number of\u000ashares in response to his tender.\u000a    In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in\u000athe statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April\u000a8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to\u000aincrease the price of his offer.\u000a    Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in\u000aplace.\u000a    Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ> has now delivered\u000ato him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing\u000adividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding\u000aCorp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.\u000a    He said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, which leads a\u000asyndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr\u000amargin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for\u000afurther commitments under the margin facility to advance up to\u000aan additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the\u000apurchase of shares under the offer.\u000a    Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,\u000aeach of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,\u000aor 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into\u000aSeries A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an\u000aindependent investment baking firm.\u000a    He said "To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares\u000aare purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a\u000acombination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value\u000aof 32 dlrs per share of Caesars."\u000a    Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to\u000aCaesars' recapitalization.\u000a    Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming\u000aofficials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory\u000aprocess required for regulatory approval, a process that it\u000aalready underway in New Jersey.\u000a    He said his offer has been extended based on the likely\u000aduration of the regulatory process.\u000a    He said he intends to further extend the offer if the\u000aapproval process is not completed by the expiration date.\u000a Reuter\u000a

Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge\u000ain economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely\u000aunderpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.\u000a    Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of\u000aPortugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,\u000apredicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth\u000awould remain at similar levels this year.\u000a    But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies\u000aand could slow economic development.\u000a    Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end\u000aof the month, can either call early elections or form a new\u000agovernment from parties in the existing left wing-dominated\u000aparliament.\u000a    Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick\u000aelections as the best solution. "There is a good chance that a\u000amajority government could result from early elections,"\u000aConfederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro\u000aFerraz da Costa said.\u000a    He said they were optimistic this could mean the\u000acontinuation in the near future of liberalisation policies\u000aintroduced over the last year.\u000a    The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but\u000athe PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls\u000asay they could win an overall majority.\u000a    A PSD majority would also open the way for more\u000awide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and\u000apossible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.\u000a    Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties\u000aof blocking key economic reforms.\u000a    The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results\u000awere more the product of favourable international conditions\u000asuch as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD\u000apolicies.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VFour of West Germany's five leading\u000aeconomic research institutes warned that excessive monetary\u000agrowth threatened a resurgence of inflation.\u000a    But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,\u000aechoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said\u000athe expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not\u000anecessarily threaten stability.\u000a    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which\u000athree -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in\u000aGNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.\u000a    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in\u000aview of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has\u000ashown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price\u000arise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.\u000a    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may\u000aseem exaggerated, they said.\u000a    "But it has often turned out in the past that the price\u000aclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into\u000aa restrictive policy," they said.\u000a    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are\u000aless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.\u000a    The four institutes disputed the view that monetary\u000aexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic\u000ainvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital market\u000ainvestments following lower interest rates.\u000a    "Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of\u000acentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a\u000asmaller expansion of money supply," they said.\u000a    A return to growth and stability did not require\u000aspectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with\u000aopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid\u000aan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.\u000a    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be\u000afocused simply on growth of production potential. Because of\u000auncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic\u000aweakness other factors should be taken into account.\u000a    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts\u000aand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation\u000aspeculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat\u000ain itself to price stability.\u000a    The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth\u000areflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the\u000afalling mark.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VPrimary dealers in U.K. Government gilts\u000awill not be required to underwrite the government's offering of\u000aits securities when the first auctions begin in Mid-May, the\u000aBank of England said.\u000a    In an official notice released today, the Bank said "There\u000awill be no formal or informal underwriting arrangement for the\u000aauctions but the Bank encourages all gilt-edged market makers,\u000aas part of their commitment to the market, to participate\u000aactively in the auction process."\u000a    The Bank was originally believed to have favoured requiring\u000athe dealers to underwrite auctions, which are patterned after\u000athose in the U.S. Treasury market.\u000a    However, the Treasury was believed to have baulked at the\u000arequest by the 27 market makers for an allotment commission\u000awhich would discourage the largest institutional investors from\u000aplacing orders for new stock directly through the Bank of\u000aEngland, thus denying primary dealers some of their best\u000acustomers. Commission would have been passed along to customers\u000awho did place orders via the primary dealers, making it less\u000aexpensive to buy through them than to go directly to the Bank.\u000a    Market sources said the Bank had, in its discussions with\u000athe dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that the\u000aallotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had a\u000aconcurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless of\u000amarket conditions.\u000a    Indeed, the Bank and the gilts dealers are believed to be\u000adisappointed that the Treasury has not agreed to go along with\u000athe plan. However, in its paper, the Bank suggested that any\u000aconditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandoned\u000aor modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficient\u000aor unwieldy.\u000a    Among other items in the document, the Bank said its first\u000aauction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventional\u000ashort-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.\u000a    Subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financial\u000ayear would first be of up to one billion stg of long-dated\u000astock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up to\u000aone billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years in\u000amaturity.\u000a    The remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would be\u000amet by traditional tap offerings of stock via the government\u000abroker.\u000a    To protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, the\u000aBank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a\u000a28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stock\u000aof the same type, and it will not necessarily resume selling\u000athe stock once the fallow period expires.\u000a    In the event that prices offered for the stock to be sold\u000aare substantially out of line with market conditions, the Bank\u000awill agree to take the stock onto its own books.\u000a    The bank would then be free to sell the stock during the\u000afallow period but not at a price below the minimum tender\u000aprice.\u000a    The Bank also said that at least initially, auctions will\u000abe alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which bidders\u000aare allotted stock at the price which they bid.\u000a    However, the Bank said it reserves the right to limit any\u000amoney market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a single\u000aauction. The Bank is widely believed to be concerned about\u000apreventing a single market maker from cornering a stock to\u000adrive the price up.\u000a   The Bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to prevent\u000adealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuing\u000aadditional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.\u000a    The Bank has also agreed to publish information about the\u000aauction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete,\u000awhich is widely expected to be on the same day.\u000a    Information to be released will include the amount of stock\u000aallotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids,\u000aand the highest, lowest and average price of the successful\u000abids.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VGAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner\u000aCorp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to\u000abe preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.\u000a     Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for\u000a4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch\u000aCapital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for\u000a89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and\u000asecurities for the balance.\u000a    Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.\u000a    "I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in\u000awith another bid," said one analyst, who values the company at\u000a51 or 52 dlrs per share.\u000a    GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of\u000aBorg-Warner's stock.\u000a    "You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up\u000athe price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have\u000ato. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking\u000aat it - that it's worth more," Pershing and Co analyst Richard\u000aHenderson said.\u000a    Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.\u000a    GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill\u000aLynch officials did not return phone calls.\u000a    Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman\u000asought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics\u000abusiness. The rigid plastics are used in such things as\u000atelephones, computer terminals, and appliances.\u000a    "Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical\u000aoperation these days," said Henderson.\u000a    "He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he\u000adoes not like to get pushed around," said Henderson.\u000a    GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover\u000aof the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF\u000adid not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its\u000ainvestment in Carbide.\u000a    Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its\u000aBorg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer\u000aand does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would\u000agive GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.\u000a    "It's a win-win situation," said one analyst.\u000a    One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be\u000aforthcoming shortly.\u000a    "I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this\u000abook," he said.\u000a    Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,\u000aprotective services, which includes Wells Fargo security\u000aguards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.\u000a    Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows\u000aGAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it\u000awould realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per\u000ashare.\u000a    "I think there's a probability he goes up in price," said\u000aRose.\u000a    Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman\u000awould do. "Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."\u000a    "Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical\u000aenterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank," Rose\u000asaid.\u000a    Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add\u000aearnings momentum to GAF. "I worked out that paying as much as\u000a50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if\u000athey sold off most of the non-chemical facilities," said John\u000aHenry of E.F. Hutton.\u000a    Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986\u000aoperating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion\u000adlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net\u000aearnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.\u000a    "The Borg chemical business is great," said Rose, adding\u000aits only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co <MCT> and Dow\u000aChemical Co <DOW>.\u000a Reuter\u000a

Lanston and Co.\u000a    "We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the\u000anear future," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\u000a    "Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding\u000acosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,"\u000asaid Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.\u000a    However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime\u000abecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loan\u000ademand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain\u000arecent upward pressure on money market interest rates.\u000a    Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift\u000ashort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He\u000asaid "if there is widespread belief money market rates will\u000astay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time."\u000a    Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a\u000adollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar\u000afell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders\u000asaid the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.\u000a    In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to\u000astabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.\u000ainterest rates higher relative to overseas rates.\u000a    Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions\u000aon Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said "it has become\u000aclear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure\u000ain the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed."\u000a    Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest\u000arates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation\u000athat the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.\u000a    That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the\u000amarket than most economists had expected.\u000a    On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small\u000aamounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements\u000awith the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another\u000ahigh at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct\u000atoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr\u000around of customer repurchase agreements.\u000a    "The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is\u000aoffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,"\u000asaid Jones of Lanston.\u000a    "The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the\u000aneed to defend the dollar," Jones said. He believes it is\u000amerely shading policy toward restraint now, "but to have a\u000amajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy\u000aovertly at some point."\u000a    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by\u000abecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within\u000afour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.\u000a    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might\u000awell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to\u000afurther aid the dollar.\u000a    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on\u000a30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate\u000amay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.\u000a    "The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening\u000apolicy to defend the dollar," said Leslie of Discount Corp. He\u000asaid tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.\u000aLeslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures\u000aabate will show whether or not it is firming policy.  \u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VTexaco Inc has re-established some key\u000aoil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for\u000aprotection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said\u000aElton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.\u000a    "Several companies say they are willing to start trading,"\u000aYates told Reuters in an interview.\u000a    The company last week had stated that a number of domestic\u000aand international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil\u000ashipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.\u000aBanks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.\u000a    Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and other banks told\u000aTexaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco\u000asaid in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and J.P.\u000aMorgan Co's <JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits\u000ato cover transactions, it said.\u000a    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose\u000afrom an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme\u000aCourt in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over\u000athe acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.\u000a    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's\u000aplea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.\u000a    "Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they\u000acould," Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court\u000aruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting\u000asupplies.\u000a    "It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an\u000aavalanche," he said. "Supplies were cut to the point where we\u000acould not run the system at anywhere near capacity."\u000a    He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in\u000ajeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages\u000aby mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton\u000asaid.\u000a    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,\u000acanceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,\u000aOccidental Petroleum Co <OXY> demanded cash for crude, and\u000aAtlantic Richfield Co <ARC> asked for special safeguards.\u000a    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC <BP> last\u000aweek refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today\u000asaid, "a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on\u000asupplying. They had cancelled last week."\u000a    He declined to identify the company.\u000a    <Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil\u000acompany that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also\u000ahalted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.\u000a    But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the\u000aVenezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key\u000asupply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the\u000aAlgerians, he added.\u000a    Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter\u000a11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines\u000aand oil supplies that are key to the company's business.\u000a    "It will be business as usual for Texaco," said Martin\u000aKlein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer\u000aand Traub.\u000a    "Creditors are a nervous bunch of people," he said. "But\u000awhen the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and\u000awill likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company."\u000a    But other officials at Texaco were not immediately\u000aavailable to say whether discussions were being held with its\u000abanks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VShares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted\u000atheir biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock\u000amarkets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the\u000adebt-heavy company.\u000a    Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and\u000agained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock\u000aExchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high\u000aas 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome\u000ahas normally moved by only a few cents per day.\u000a    TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr\u000aCanadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but\u000aDome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still\u000atalking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.\u000a    Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed\u000ato be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday\u000astressed that its bid is "a Canadian solution to the financial\u000adifficulties of Dome Petroleum."\u000a    "The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont\u000a<DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC>, which sold its Canadian\u000ainterest in 1975 and could be getting back in," said Wilf Gobert\u000aof Peters and Co Ltd.\u000a    David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British\u000aPetroleum PLC <BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite\u000aBP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent\u000aof Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own.\u000a    Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said\u000ain recent reports that Amoco Corp <AN> has also been in talks\u000awith Dome.\u000a    Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,\u000aConoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.\u000a    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as "awfully\u000aoptimistic," given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome\u000ashareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10\u000adlrs Canadian per common share.\u000a    Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred\u000ashareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which\u000awould own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada\u000awould own 80 pct.\u000a    However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the\u000apotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. "The\u000aTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,"\u000ahe said.\u000a    Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is "at the\u000aupper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome."\u000a    The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87\u000abillion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another\u000aone billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to\u000asecured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a\u000acertain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.\u000a    Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion\u000aCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on\u000aseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the company\u000awanted to expand.\u000a    "There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable\u000aof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that\u000abasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,"\u000aGobert said.\u000a    Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it\u000ais a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds\u000areserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion\u000acubic feet of natural gas.\u000a    The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres\u000aof oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the\u000aheart of Canada's oil industry.\u000a   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of\u000aland across Canada.\u000a   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs\u000aCanadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of\u000a2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the\u000alargest ever by a Canadian company.\u000a   \u000a Reuter\u000a

The policy shift, which\u000ameans abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign\u000adebt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.\u000a    Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the\u000acurrent account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight\u000abillion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion\u000adlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation\u000aand rationalising exports.\u000a    He said Seoul would try to limit its current account\u000asurplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few\u000ayears, although trade volume would continue to grow.\u000a    "This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP\u000a(gross national product) from the current five pct level to\u000athree pct by 1991," he added.\u000a    Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreign\u000adebt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end\u000aof 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5\u000abillion dlrs at end-1986.\u000a    "But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to\u000aremain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower\u000athan the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs," he said.\u000a    The policy change was announced two days before the\u000ascheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige\u000afor talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.\u000a    South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral\u000atrade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from\u000a4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.\u000a    Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing\u000ain South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion\u000adlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln\u000adlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose\u000a36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.\u000a    The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5\u000abillion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw\u000amaterials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.\u000a    "The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at\u000a1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are\u000aconsiderable incentives given to increase imports," Koo said.\u000a    Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency.\u000a"It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean\u000acurrency continues to rise in value," he said.\u000a    He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the\u000adollar gradually, but added "We do not believe in rapid one-shot\u000achanges in the value of the won."\u000a    The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six\u000apct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VInternational banks have radically\u000achanged their attitudes towards debt and lending and debtor\u000anations will have to explore new methods of ensuring inflows,\u000aPhilippine Central Bank Governor Jose Fernandez said.\u000a    "Commercial banks have tended to be rather difficult in\u000aterms of new money for some time now," he told reporters at a\u000anews conference. "Within the world there are enormous changes\u000ataking place in attitudes of different banks."\u000a    He said the banks were no longer flush with funds from the\u000apost-1973 oil boom and were reluctant to lend money.\u000a    "They don't have the same kind of money they used to have\u000a... They find their whole deposit base eroding," Fernandez said.\u000aGroups of major banks had decided that the international arena\u000awas not to their liking.\u000a    "They wind up with 7/8 (over Eurodollar rates) and who wants\u000a7/8 really? It's nothing. They want to get the frills, but if\u000athey are not big enough they don't get the frills."\u000a    The Philippines on Wednesday announced it wanted to\u000arenegotiate a debt restructuring accord it reached on March 27\u000awith its 12-bank advisory committee, saying it wanted the same\u000aterms as were granted to Argentina earlier this week.\u000a    Argentina was granted a 19-year repayment at 13/16 points\u000aover Eurodollar rates, the same historically low spread that\u000aMexico won last October, while the Philippines, which had\u000ainsisted on a deal similar to Mexico's, restructured 10.3\u000abillion dlrs of its 28.2 billion dlr foreign debt at 7/8.\u000a    Fernandez said the old type of new-money agreement, where\u000ahundreds of banks were forced into involuntary lending by an\u000aadvisory committee that negotiated agreements with debtor\u000acountries, was becoming increasingly difficult.\u000a    He said involuntary lending proved useful in the two or\u000athree years since the Mexican debt crisis in 1982.\u000a    "But the present tendency has been that more and more of the\u000abanks, specially the regionals or the small ones, have either\u000asold off their portfolios or simply by policy will not put up\u000aany more money," Fernandez said.\u000a    He said another disturbing development was the so-called\u000anational quota approach adopted by groups of banks.\u000a    "Groups of banks by nationality have chosen to take a look\u000aat what other groups of banks in other countries are willing to\u000ado and if let us say British banks wind up giving 99 pct of\u000awhat is needed and U.S. Banks give only 92 pct, then the\u000aBritish banks say as a whole they will pull out," he said.\u000a    "There are banks that have decided that lending is not a\u000agood business any more.

a(VBasic reform of Japan's protected farm\u000asector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to\u000adomestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade\u000asurplus, securities analysts said.\u000a    The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and\u000aquotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and\u000asheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they\u000asaid.\u000a    "In economic terms, reform would be a plus," said Christopher\u000aChew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.\u000a    The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices\u000atwice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,\u000aThe analysts said.\u000a    Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the\u000aaverage household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross\u000anational product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.\u000a    Reducing these prices could increase household spending\u000apower by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on\u000aproducts which would have a more direct impact in boosting\u000adomestic growth, it added.\u000a    "There's a lot of slack," a U.S. Government official in Tokyo\u000asaid. "All that money could be spent on something else."\u000a    Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector\u000aamount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent\u000aestimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37\u000abillion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.\u000a    Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm\u000aon weekends to put their land up for sale for residential\u000adevelopment would also give a boost to domestic spending,\u000aeconomists said.\u000a    "Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the\u000aexpansion of domestic demand," wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor\u000aat Kyoto Gakuen University.\u000a    Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform\u000ato shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic\u000arestructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the\u000afarm sector. Employers groups also want change. "If you really\u000awant to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to\u000araise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices," Bumpei\u000aOtsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'\u000aAssociations told a recent press conference.\u000a    External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek\u000aremoval of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade\u000adeficits with Japan.\u000a    But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well\u000aentrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.\u000a    Although the full-time farm population is falling and there\u000aare signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban\u000aconstituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on\u000afarm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several\u000acity votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.\u000a    The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform\u000aplan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,\u000athe analysts said.\u000a    Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the\u000atraditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for\u000anational food security, they said.\u000a    Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to\u000aimport liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms\u000aaimed at stepping up productivity, they said.\u000a    Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific\u000apressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.\u000a REUTER\u000a

The February increase was less than\u000aJanauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for\u000athe later months of 1986.\u000a    Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in\u000aJanuary was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year. \u000a    Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January's\u000a1.1 pct increase.

a(VU.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng\u000aopens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware\u000ahis demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus\u000amarkets is likely to be rejected.\u000a     But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to\u000aTokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an\u000ainternational spotlight on Japan's agricultural import\u000aprotection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open\u000aits markets.\u000a    "(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but\u000athey are not going to give us anything," Lyng said.\u000a    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions\u000aduring Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions\u000awould be unveiled later this month, they said.\u000a    "If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime\u000aMinister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him," when he\u000avisits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.\u000a    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by\u000apartially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.\u000a    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week\u000arequesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses\u000asuch as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying\u000aTokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.\u000a    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for\u000abeef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would\u000alike to buy much more beef than currently allowed.\u000a    He cited the example of a California company which\u000atransports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to\u000acircumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than\u000athe value of the animal, he said.\u000a    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion\u000aCorporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow\u000afrom the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986\u000aquota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan\u000ahas said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.\u000a    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to\u000aeliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by\u000aApril, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually\u000abe willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because\u000aliberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese\u000amandarin orange industry.\u000a    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because\u000aimports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And\u000aJapanese officials have said.\u000a   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy\u000asurplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,\u000abut some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.\u000a   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,\u000aincluding rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in\u000aGeneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain\u000aminor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VArgentina's controversial new\u000afinancing package should be completed quickly thanks to a wide\u000arange of innovative options in the deal, said Jorge Gonzalez,\u000aundersecretary for external debt in the economics ministry.\u000a    The deal offers banks a lucrative fee if they sign early\u000aand an "exit bond" provision allowing banks to sell as much as\u000afive mln dlrs of their existing loans. Gonzalez also disclosed\u000athat banks will have the choice of lending up to one mln dlrs\u000ain the form of a bearer bond. "We expect to complete the\u000apackage very quickly," he said in a telephone interview.\u000a    By providing their share of the 1.55 billion dlrs in new\u000amoney being raised for Argentina via an easily tradable bearer\u000abond instead of a participation in the syndicated loan, smaller\u000abanks could avoid time-consuming legal paperwork.\u000a    The bonds, currently dubbed "alternative participation\u000ainstruments," would carry the same terms as the syndicated loan\u000a- a 12-year term, five years' grace and an interest rate margin\u000aof 7/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, Gonzalez said.\u000a    The idea of the "exit bond" is that a creditor bank may\u000aexchange up to five mln dlrs of existing debt for a new,\u000atradeable bond that bears below-market interest rates.\u000a    In return for accepting a lower yield, the amount of debt\u000aconverted will be subtracted from the bank's exposure for\u000apurposes of calculating its contribution to future new loans.\u000a    Gonzalez said it was difficult to say how many banks would\u000atake up the "exit bonds" because no such instrument has been\u000aoffered before.\u000a    On paper, however, Argentina's lending syndicate could\u000ashrink dramatically because over 100 of the country's 350\u000acreditors have exposure of less than five mln dlrs.\u000a    Details of the "exit bonds" are still being finalized,\u000aGonzalez added.\u000a    Argentina has pressed hard for a streamlining of the\u000alending process because it has bitter memories of its last\u000apackage, which was agreed with the Citibank-led steering\u000acommittee in December 1984 but not signed until August 1985.\u000a    Gonzalez praised the committee for its cooperation in the\u000alatest negotiations and said the resulting deal, which was\u000aannounced by the banks on Wednesday, should put Argentina on\u000athe road to meeting its economic goals.\u000a    "We believe this is a package that will help Argentine to\u000acontinue on the track it has elected to follow - stable growth\u000aand equilibrium in the external accounts," he said.\u000a    Asked what role the Reagan Administration had played in the\u000afinal stages of the talks, Gonzalez said it had lent "practical\u000asupport."\u000a    He did not elaborate, but bankers said the U.S. had pressed\u000afor an agreement after Economics Minister Juan Sourrouille\u000athreatened at last week's spring meeting in Washington of the\u000aInternational Monetary Fund to break off talks unless banks\u000astopped blocking a deal.\u000a    The specter of Argentina emulating Brazil and suspending\u000ainterest payments haunted policymakers and bankers alike, who\u000ahave long feared the emergence of a debtors' cartel.\u000a    "That was a feeling among people on the committee," one\u000abanker said.\u000a    As a result bankers agreed to give Argentina the same\u000ainterest rate margin as Mexico, 13/16 pct, on the rescheduling\u000aof 30 billion dlrs of debt, even though they knew this would\u000araise the ire of the Philippines and Venezuela, which paid 7/8\u000apct on recent rescheduling packages.\u000a    Asked about the angry reaction of the Manila government,\u000awhich promptly said Wednesday that it would demand a spread of\u000a13/16 pct, Gonzalez said this was a matter between the\u000aPhilippines and the banks.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VSenior U.S. bankers are seeking to\u000acalm the furore in the Philippines caused by the terms of\u000aArgentina's new financing package, but a source in New York\u000aclose to the Manila government said finance minister Jaime\u000aOngpin is in no mood for compromise.\u000a    Ongpin is angry because the banks granted Argentina an\u000ainterest rate spread of 13/16 pct, the same as Mexico won, just\u000aweeks after telling the Philippines that it must accept 7/8 pct\u000abecause the Mexican margin could never be repeated.\u000a    Bankers acknowledged the political sensitivity of the\u000ainterest spread but urged Ongpin to examine the Argentine\u000apackage in its entirety.\u000a    Argentina, for instance, is offering banks a 3/8 pct\u000aparticipation fee if they sign up for the deal within 30 days\u000a(declining to 1/8 pct if banks commit within 60 days), which\u000aboosts the all-in interest rate it is paying on the package.\u000a    "You can make the case that the deal is not 13/16 pct," one\u000abanker said. Another, referring to the Philippine debt\u000anegotiators, said "The only reason they'd have to come back to\u000aNew York is political, not economic."\u000a    Ongpin has said as much himself, estimating that an extra\u000a1/16 percentage point would cost just 5.1 mln dlrs a year.\u000a    But the source close to the Philippines said Ongpin's anger\u000agoes beyond the dollars. He said the minister feels personally\u000abetrayed by bankers who insisted Mexico's 13/16 pct was a\u000arock-bottom spread that could not be duplicated. Top U.S.\u000aTreasury and Federal Reserve officials had said the same.\u000a    The source said Ongpin is unlikely to come to the U.S. to\u000apress his case and was expecting the Philippines' bank advisory\u000acommittee, headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, to\u000anegotiate the spread reduction by telex.\u000a    Ongpin has not said the Philippines will unilaterally start\u000apaying interest at the lower rate but has made it clear to the\u000acommittee in a telex that he is not prepared to pay more than\u000aMexico and Argentina, the source said.\u000a    "The Philippines really means business on this. I don't\u000athink there's much room for compromise," he said.\u000a    Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on the issue.\u000a    The Philippines last month won an agreement to reschedule\u000a10.3 billion dlrs of debt over 17 years at an interest rate of\u000a7/8 pct, whereas some 30 billion dlrs in old Argentine debt\u000awill be stretched out over 19 years with a spread of 13/16 pct.\u000a    Bankers said they were forced to break their word because\u000apolitical circumstances had changed in the past few weeks.\u000a    In particular, they said it had become clear that Argentina\u000awas serious about its threat to suspend interest payments\u000aunless it got a good deal. Fearing that an Argentine moratorium\u000awould stiffen the resolve of its neighbour Brazil, which has\u000aalready suspended payments, the banks, at the urging of the\u000aReagan Administration, bowed to Argentina's demands.\u000a    Some U.S. bankers argued that, regardless of politics, the\u000arich menu of options in the Argentine package makes it\u000aattractive enough to justify a 13/16 pct rescheduling rate.\u000a    "When they (the Philippines) see the whole package, they\u000amay realize that this is not a Mexican deal," one banker said\u000aof the Argentine agreement.\u000a    The Argentine pact contains several features that were not\u000ain the Mexican accord such as "exit bonds," an option to\u000aprovide new money via bearer bonds, a trade facility, onlending\u000aprovisions and a debt-equity conversion scheme.\u000a    Moreover, Argentina is requesting only 1.95 billion dlrs in\u000anew loans, compared with Mexico's 7.7 billion, and is paying\u000a7/8 pct for most of the money instead of the 13/16 pct charged\u000ato Mexico.\u000a    This line of argument cuts no ice with the Filipinos, who\u000anote drily that they asked for no new money at all.\u000a    "The banks reacted on the level of politics to Argentina\u000aand try to justify it in terms of economics, and now they're\u000agoing to have problems with both the Philippines and\u000aVenezuela," said the source close to the Manila government.\u000a    Because of the Easter holidays bankers have not yet got an\u000aofficial reaction from Venezuela, which is also paying 7/8 pct\u000aon its 20.2 billion dlr rescheduling. But they acknowledged\u000athat Caracas, which was also told that the Mexico spread was\u000ainviolate, is quite likely to demand a lower spread.\u000a    Bankers were more sanguine in the case of Chile.\u000a    Because it is under fire for its human-rights record, the\u000agovernment of General Augusto Pinochet is unlikely to attract\u000aattention to itself by seeking to renegotiate its recent debt\u000apackage, which carries interest of one pct, bankers said.\u000a    They hope that, once tempers cool, the Philippines will\u000aalso accept that reopening an agreement that took 4-1/2 tough\u000amonths to negotiate will be more trouble than it is worth.\u000a Reuter\u000a

The\u000atariffs were placed on items which were available from other\u000asources so there would be little effect on the American\u000aconsumer, Fitzwater said.\u000a    Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action\u000a- especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade\u000apractices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.\u000a    The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.\u000a    The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion\u000adlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about\u000aone-third of America's overall deficit.\u000a    But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West\u000aGermany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the\u000apresident is ready to fight them all.\u000a    Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that "I regret\u000athat these actions are necessary," but that the health and\u000avitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to\u000aAmerican competitiveness in world markets.\u000a    "We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading\u000apractices," Reagan added in the statement from his California\u000avacation home at Santa Barbara.\u000a    He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan\u000aabided by the agreement.\u000a    U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -\u000awhich is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he\u000aalready has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.\u000a    The White House aide said of the tariff action, "it wasn't\u000adone to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade\u000apractice."\u000a    The aide added, however, "on another plane, it was an\u000aexample of how the administration uses the trade law to fight\u000aunfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major\u000aoverall of our trade laws."\u000a    But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not\u000ain the best interests of the United States, and that\u000anegotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.\u000a    "It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route," he\u000asaid, "because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in\u000atrade."\u000a    Crandall said, "the administration is doing this for its\u000apolitical impact across the country, and therefore its impact\u000aon Congress."\u000a    He said, "I don't think it makes a lot of sense."\u000a    But other analysts said it made little difference whether\u000athe tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,\u000aand that the main point was that the trading partners were on\u000anotice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.\u000a    Spokesman Fitzwater said "we don't want a trade war," but the\u000aimposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when\u000ait had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.\u000a    Crandall said, "the administration is doing this for its\u000apolitical impact across the country, and therefore its impact\u000aon Congress."\u000a    He said, "I don't think it makes a lot of sense."\u000a    But other analysts said it made little difference whether\u000athe tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,\u000aand that the main point was that the trading partners were on\u000anotice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.\u000a    Spokesman Fitzwater said "we don't want a trade war," but the\u000aimposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when\u000ait had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VU.S. banking data released today are\u000atoo distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary\u000apolicy, but they do support the market's assumption that the\u000aFederal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,\u000aeconomists said.\u000a    "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount\u000awindow borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate\u000aaverage and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent\u000awith a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First Chicago\u000aCorp.\u000a    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that\u000athe Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.\u000a    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were\u000a935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week\u000astatement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of\u000aDecember 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.\u000a    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion\u000adlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this\u000ayear - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the\u000aFed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in\u000areserves than the Fed had anticipated.\u000a    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed\u000ais aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than\u000awitnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have\u000aforced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.\u000a    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week\u000aended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,\u000apartly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the\u000aproceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to\u000apay annual income taxes.\u000a    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the\u000areserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.\u000a    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion\u000adlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists\u000asaid the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the\u000aprojected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to\u000aadd reserves too late.\u000a    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently\u000aleft Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which\u000ato enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists\u000asaid. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos\u000aoutstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add\u000aeven more reserves but was prevented from doing so.\u000a    "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as\u000amuch as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"\u000asaid Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.\u000a    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting\u000adiscount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,\u000aequivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.\u000a    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not\u000atightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,\u000aeconomists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging \u000aovernight injections of reserves until the last day of the\u000astatement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.\u000a    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that\u000athe Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's\u000afigures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving\u000atoward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."\u000a    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8\u000apct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate\u000aunless the dollar's fall gathers pace.\u000a    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political\u000aopposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time\u000awhen Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to\u000areducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VRising interest rates and\u000aprotectionist trade policies had prompted a new push by Latin\u000aAmerican nations to win debt relief, regional foreign and\u000afinance ministry officials said here.\u000a    Officials of the Cartagena group of 11 debtor nations met\u000ahere this week to draw up new proposals in reaction to what\u000athey called a deteriorating world panorama, and Citicorp's\u000adecision to create reserves against third world loans.\u000a    (SEE ECRA FOR SPOTLIGHT HEADLINES)\u000a    "We are looking at trade, interest rates and financial\u000aflows.....In order to put forward a basis for some permanent\u000asolutions," Mexico's public credit director Angel Gurria said.\u000a    Recent developments have led to moves for a summit of Latin\u000aAmerican presidents and debate on new solutions.\u000a    Ideas include schemes to link debt payments to trade, and\u000aproposals for stable interest rates. The latter was proposed in\u000aa letter this week from Cartagena to G-7 leaders who are due to\u000aattend a summit in Venice this month.\u000a    Another idea is to include debt under Gatt negotiations,\u000abut Cartegena ministers have yet to endorse any proposals.\u000a    Speaking earlier in New York, Uruguay's Foreign Minister\u000aand Cartagena group chairman Enrique Iglesias said Citicorp's\u000adecision could discourage new lending. But it might help\u000aCartagena's bid to have old and new debt treated separately.\u000a    The Cartagena group, which has not met at ministerial level\u000afor over a year, wants to repay debt contracted before the debt\u000acrisis at the low interest rates prevailing in the 1970s. It\u000awould pay new loans at current market rates.\u000a    "Many countries fear that what they have gained in months of\u000aarduous debt negotiations they can lose at a stroke with a one\u000apoint rise in interest rates," one official here said.\u000a    "The new increase in interest rates has come precisely when\u000awe thought they had still not come down enough," Iglesias said.\u000a    Latin American officials are also concerned that varying\u000ainterest spreads granted to different debtor nations could\u000agenerate discord, as with the Philippines' recent protest at\u000abeing given less favourable terms than Argentina.\u000a    There has been speculation Venezuela would demand a cut in\u000aits 7/8 pct spread, but public finances director Jorge Marcano\u000asaid here there were no plans to renegotiate terms.\u000a    This week's meeting came after three Latin American\u000apresidents meeting in Montevideo called for stable interest\u000arates on the region's 380 billion dlr foreign debt. It was\u000acalled to review developments since the last ministerial\u000ameeting in February 1986 and to think up new ideas.\u000a    Since the last ministerial meeting there have been some\u000aadvances, such as Mexico's growth-oriented 77 billion dlr loan\u000aand refinancing package agreed last September. But there have\u000aalso been setbacks, like Brazil's payments moratorium.\u000a    The loans expected in the Baker plan have not materialized\u000aand debtors have been forced to browbeat reluctant banks.\u000a    "We have clearly stretched the restructuring process to its\u000alimits and and the question is now where do we go from here?" a\u000asenior Mexican foreign ministry official said.\u000a    Existing debt strategy has been based on nursing debtor\u000aeconomies back to a position where they can again service their\u000adebts and qualify for new loans.\u000a    But after five years of economic adjustment, Latin American\u000adebtors are currently unable to raise voluntary credits, with\u000athe exception of Colombia. Only Venezuela is paying back\u000aprincipal. Most countries have no prospect of paying their\u000adebts in the foreseeable future.\u000a    Citicorp has made clear its decision to move three billion\u000adlrs to reserves does not mean it is writing-off the loans.\u000a    Latin American officials here said Citicorp's move would\u000aprobably boost trading of discounted third world debt in the\u000asecondary market, implicitly downvaluing the amount owed. But\u000athey said it might make new lending even more remote.\u000a    Discounted debt can be bought by foreign investors through\u000adebt-equity schemes that generate new resources for debtor\u000aeconomies. Chile and Mexico are currently front-runners in this\u000afield, but most Latin American officials see these schemes as\u000alimited and no panacea for the overall problem.\u000a    Most Latin officials set greater store on building up\u000aexport income than on debt-equity schemes.\u000a    Exports hit 97.7 billion dlrs in 1984, cutting the region's\u000adebt service ratio to 36 pct, but they fell to 78.3 billion\u000alast year. So, even though interest rates had dropped the ratio\u000ahardly changed.\u000a    The Cartagena group has called for the debt-trade link to\u000abe recognized before, but has not made detailed proposals.\u000a    Officials said initiatives discussed here would be\u000asubmitted to foreign and finance ministers of the 11 nations,\u000abefore IMF and World Bank annual meetings later this year.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VVenezuela has no plans to try\u000ato renegotiate the debt rescheduling agreement it worked out\u000awith creditor banks in February, public finance director Jorge\u000aMarcano told Reuters.\u000a    Speaking here after a meeting of the 11-nation Cartagena\u000agroup, Marcano said he was aware of political pressure at home\u000ato reduce debt payments but did not think such a move would\u000abenefit Venezuela.\u000a    "We have no intention of revising the terms of the accord,"\u000ahe said. "There would be little to gain and in fact it would\u000aprobably be detrimental."\u000a    Venezuela agreed with its bank advisory committee on a 14.5\u000ayear rescheduling of 20.3 billion dlrs in public sector foreign\u000adebt, with an interest rate 7/8 pct over Libor. The previous\u000aagreement, reached a year before but never implemented, was for\u000a12-1/2 years with a 1-1/8 pct spread.\u000a    In Caracas there have recently been calls to invoke the\u000aagreement's contingency clause which the government used last\u000ayear to amend the original terms after a 40 pct drop in oil\u000aincome.\u000a    But Marcano said the bulk of payments to be made this year\u000aare on private debts and non-rescheduled public debts.\u000a    Marcano said Venezuela, which has reduced its debt by six\u000abillion dlrs since 1983, should have no problems in repaying\u000arestructured debt this year or next.\u000a    Asked whether the government felt badly treated with its\u000a7/8 pct spread when Mexico and Argentina have won a 13/16 pct\u000amargin, Marcano said he still felt Venezuela had a good deal.\u000a    "Venezuela has restructured its debt so that most of it is\u000abeing repaid at 7/8 pct, which I think is better than the other\u000acountries," he said. The rescheduling accord covers some 90 pct\u000aof Venezuela's commercial bank debt, which accounts for more\u000athan 90 pct of the total public sector external debt.\u000a    Venezuela has almost no debt outstanding to multilateral\u000aagencies.\u000a    Marcano said attempting to revise the rescheduling accord a\u000asecond time would probably hurt Venezuela's bid to restore it\u000acredit rating and raise new loans.\u000a    He said Venezuela now obtains trade credit lines without a\u000agovernment guarantee, something that Argentina and others are\u000ajust starting to try to negotiate in their restructuring\u000apackages.\u000a    Venezuela is currently seeking loans in Japan and West\u000aGermany to finance steel and aluminium expansion.\u000a    According to finance minister Manuel Azpurua, a 100 mln\u000amark credit has been lined up for the Venalum aluminium plant.\u000a    Marcano said no mandate has yet been given for a planned\u000a100 mln dlr bond issue, although he confirmed that talks were\u000acontinuing with Morgan Guaranty and other banks.\u000a    Banking sources said one option was to privately place the\u000abonds through the Caracas-based Banco de Venezuela, which would\u000aunderwrite the issue, but Marcano said no decision has yet been\u000amade.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VPhilippine Coconut Authority (PCA)\u000achairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this\u000amonth to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community\u000a(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.\u000a    "I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting\u000aup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries\u000alike the Philippines," Romero said in an interview.\u000a    He said he did not know how much support the levy had\u000awithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed\u000ato the tax were under pressure to change their position.\u000a    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the\u000aNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But\u000athere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change\u000asides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.\u000a    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning\u000athat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained\u000adangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.\u000a    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per\u000amillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to\u000aapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra\u000acake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.\u000a    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it\u000ais not properly dried or ground.\u000a    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in\u000aLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC\u000astandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,\u000abut this was likely to take several years of research.\u000a    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total\u000acoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.\u000a    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's\u000adepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways of\u000aavoiding the copra process altogether.\u000a    "There are ways of producing coconut products outside of\u000acopra," Romero said. "We can process fresh coconut without drying\u000athe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process\u000acoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to\u000athe chemical root."\u000a    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to\u000abecome more protectionist and he expected export prices of\u000acoconut products to drop.\u000a    "In the long term we will be getting less and less for more\u000aand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that," he\u000asaid.\u000a    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up\u000aproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil\u000aoutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.\u000a    "To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending\u000abillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by\u000asaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,"\u000ahe said.\u000a    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to\u000astay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a\u000ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,\u000aand a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.\u000a    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year\u000acoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall\u000aafter two successive years of good harvests.\u000a    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to\u000aadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.\u000a    "Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the\u000aprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep\u000aprices stable is by processing, adding more value," he said.\u000a    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by\u000aplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.\u000a    "A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on\u000a10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space," Romero\u000asaid. He said the government's proposed land reform program\u000awould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they\u000ahad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.\u000a    "If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,\u000aproduction and employment then it won't happen," he said.\u000a    PCA figures show about one-third of the country's\u000apopulation is dependent on the coconut industry.\u000a    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or\u000aone-fourth of total agricultural land.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VCrude oil prices could remain around 18\u000adlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on\u000aoutput at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an\u000aofficial of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos\u000a(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.\u000a    Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of\u000ainternational trade, said current OPEC output already appeared\u000ato be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself\u000afor the third quarter. "Production is surging ahead of what was\u000aoriginally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than\u000aenvisaged a few months ago," he said.\u000a    He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of\u000aproduction in the third quarter would effectively sustain the\u000a18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been\u000aenvisaged might soften price levels.\u000a    The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in\u000aVienna to review its December accord on prices and output.\u000a    "I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in\u000aterms of volume decisions," Lajous said.\u000a    A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted\u000aoutput and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is\u000aalways there as a possibility, he said.\u000a    "I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I\u000aexpect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and\u000adiscipline will be maintained," he said.\u000a    Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as\u000athis remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil\u000amarkets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during\u000a1987 if output remains under control.\u000a    He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that\u000aincreased production was not so important as long as incomes\u000awould not be affected by the output, were "very relevant and\u000awelcome from such a powerful producer."\u000a REUTER\u000a

If OPEC adopts\u000athe provisional ceilings of 16.6 mln bpd in third quarter and\u000a18.3 mln bpd in the fourth, there will probably be room for\u000aoverproduction in the third quarter when demand for its crude\u000awill probably be 17.5 to 18 mln, it said.\u000a    It said that the UAE and Ecuador may demand higher quotas\u000ain Vienna, but the biggest obstacle is Iraq, which has refused\u000ato honour its quota as it is less than that of Gulf War enemy\u000aIran.\u000a    But OPEC appears committed to a short meeting and realises\u000asomething must be done about the Iraq issue, the report said.\u000a    According to Kleinwort's sources, Saudi Arabia has already\u000aheld separate talks with Iran and Iraq and is urging Iraq to be\u000amore moderate.\u000a    "One strong indication that some kind of deal may be\u000aeventually worked out is the almost complete silence coming\u000afrom Iran," it said.\u000a    Indications are that, in return for going along with the\u000aSaudi desire to maintain official prices in Vienna, Iran is\u000aseeking concessions from the kingdom on the Iraq issue, it\u000asaid.\u000a    Kleinwort said the kingdom will face an increasingly uphill\u000atask in trying to maintain prices around 18 dlrs beyond 1987.\u000a    Firstly, OPEC hardliners led by Iran are bound to oppose\u000asuch a move. Secondly, other OPEC members will press for\u000aanother price rise if the dollar remains weak against other\u000acurrencies.\u000a    Thirdly, Saudi Arabia may be forced to raise prices earlier\u000athan it intended to ward off growing calls for higher prices\u000afrom the U.S. To stimulate domestic drilling and exploration.\u000a    The report concluded that there is a strong possibility\u000aofficial OPEC prices will rise to 20 dlrs a barrel by end-1987\u000aand 22 dlrs a barrel by end-1988.\u000a REUTER\u000a\u000a\u000a

a(VA cut of about half a percentage point\u000ain Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although\u000aeconomists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.\u000a    Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,\u000aencouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide\u000apremiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,\u000amight lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.\u000a    Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances\u000arate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its\u000arepurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.\u000a    That rate has remained in force, just holding above the\u000afive pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial\u000abank borrowings.\u000a    Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German\u000arepo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,\u000aforcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.\u000a    In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to\u000athree pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money\u000amarket rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans\u000arate on lending under its three month credit quota.\u000a    Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance\u000aMinistry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.\u000a    In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he\u000awould follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance\u000aMinistry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion\u000aguilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct\u000afor an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.\u000a    Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference\u000abetween the secured loans rate which applies to lending under\u000athe credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add\u000aextra liquidity to the money market.\u000a    Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to\u000afurther lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would\u000aresult in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,\u000aprovided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.\u000a    The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its\u000aparity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673\u000aguilders per 100 marks.\u000a    Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10\u000aguilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level\u000athat would not permit a change in the interest rate\u000adifferential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers\u000asaid.\u000a    An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and\u000aDutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he\u000asaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation\u000aexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates\u000ain the longer term.\u000a    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,\u000aor even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts\u000apoint to a falling rate of economic growth.\u000a    "It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement\u000anegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,"\u000athe ABN economist said.\u000a    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in\u000aJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.\u000a    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to\u000atwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,\u000acurrently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the\u000asecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.\u000a    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying\u000aspree on the bond market which would bring yields down,\u000aprobably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below\u000afive pct.\u000a    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in\u000athe money market.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VComputer Associates International Inc's\u000a800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp <UCE> will eliminate its\u000astrongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition\u000afrom International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, Wall Street\u000aanalysts said.\u000a     "IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems\u000asoftware," said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin\u000aand Jenrette.\u000a    "But the combination of the two companies will clearly\u000apresent a much stronger front," he said.\u000a    Besides IBM, "Computer Associates will be far and away the\u000amost powerful company in the field," added E.F. Hutton analyst\u000aTerence Quinn.\u000a    That field is a segment of the market known as system\u000autilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of\u000aa company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,\u000apower and efficiency of large mainframe computers.\u000a    The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the\u000atwo biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.\u000aAnalysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that\u000awill find the competition much harder than in the past.\u000a    For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a\u000asix-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,\u000aN.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.\u000a    When the deal is completed sometime in August, the\u000acompany's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past \u000aMicrosoft Corp <MFST> as the world's largest independent\u000asoftware vendor.\u000a    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang\u000atook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought\u000a15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3\u000amln dlrs for the year ended March 31.\u000a    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer\u000abusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe\u000acomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.\u000a    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the\u000amerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.\u000a    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six\u000acompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.\u000a    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on\u000asales of 141.5 mln dlrs.\u000a    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely\u000abecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,\u000aDallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the\u000adark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or\u000a56 cts a share.\u000a   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different\u000abusinesses, only three of which were involved in computer\u000asoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a\u000amajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his\u000ajob as chairman of General Electric Co's <GE> computer services\u000aunit.\u000a    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a\u000anews conference that the merger would give computer users a\u000asingle source for a wide range of software products.\u000a    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also\u000asell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads\u000ain the applications software market, where analysts said it has\u000abeen successful with accounting and banking systems.\u000a    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and\u000aenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the\u000acompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said\u000aabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.\u000a    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of\u000acurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But\u000athey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute\u000aComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.\u000a    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of\u000acompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,\u000ahe said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05\u000adlrs a share.\u000a    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations\u000aof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing\u000aand research and development.\u000a    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.\u000aBased on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50\u000adlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly\u000a33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.\u000a    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most\u000asoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 times\u000aper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the\u000apremium because of its earnings potential and customer base.\u000a\u000a    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25\u000apct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently\u000aowns 58 pct of Uccel.\u000a    The executive said the merger would not alter his target of\u000amaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.\u000a    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the\u000adeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice\u000aDepartment.\u000a    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the\u000amerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.\u000a\u000a Reuter\u000a

COMEX announced Friday the lifting\u000aof all daily limits, effective today.\u000a    Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per\u000aounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the\u000anearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.\u000a    Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back\u000amonths, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby\u000acontracts amid quiet trading today.\u000a    During the last week of April, silver futures often traded\u000aat the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the\u000adollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or\u000aunlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.\u000a    As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many\u000aunmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.\u000a    The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs\u000afor failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.\u000a    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,\u000asaid the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic\u000abuying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.\u000a    O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would\u000aadd caution to trading.\u000a    "This is a more realistic approach because the metals\u000amarket is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"\u000aO'Neill said.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VEuropean free market tin traders made a\u000asomewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur\u000adollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October.\u000a    Traders said the new market would probably be a useful\u000atrading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin\u000ainterests although European traders generally appear to be\u000areasonably satisfied with the current "free market" system\u000awhich has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin\u000atrading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to\u000asee how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and\u000awhat sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.\u000a    There is also a view among European traders that, while the\u000aproposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another\u000auseful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian\u000agovernment -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by\u000athe trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.\u000a    Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of\u000atrading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while\u000athere has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject\u000aa definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court\u000alitigation actions have been resolved.\u000a    Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently\u000aaround 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse\u000aRotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten\u000ayear low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as\u000a4,680 stg in December 1986.\u000a    This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading\u000aceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350\u000astg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.\u000a    LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065\u000atonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485\u000atonnes reached in February 1986.\u000a    Traders said the free market turned bullish during late\u000alast year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand\u000adeficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting\u000aprices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.\u000a    However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing\u000ain sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to\u000a4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.\u000a    The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very\u000alittle metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.\u000a    There was also a lack of significant demand from major\u000asteel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.\u000a    Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin\u000aholdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,\u000aand the bulk of material still available is being held by\u000aMalaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the\u000amarket with unwanted metal.\u000a    Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the\u000aInternational Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted\u000asupport operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members\u000anations of the International Tin Agreement.\u000a    The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker\u000aShearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported\u000ahaving sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin\u000aposition.\u000a    Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin\u000aprices and movements are still expected to be largely related\u000ato currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand\u000aemerges for the third quarter.\u000a    The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made\u000aefforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world\u000aprices by attempting to bring all major producers under an\u000aexport control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two\u000amajor producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and\u000aapparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to\u000aconsumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.\u000a Reuter\u000a

Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be\u000aexchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.\u000a    Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group,\u000awhich the company did not identify, topped his offer between\u000anow and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an\u000aopportunity to respond.\u000a    Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did\u000asay the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement\u000aregarding management's equity participation.\u000a    Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management\u000aparticpation was "nominal."\u000a    Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19.

The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the\u000afiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings,\u000ahe said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln\u000adlrs.\u000a    Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people\u000athan many competitors, but it competes on price even though\u000acompetitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins.\u000aHe noted that there have been no other publicly identified\u000abidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier\u000aBilzerian proposal in mid-April.\u000a    Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for\u000aanother bidder to get in the game.

USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed\u000aanalysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.\u000a    At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the\u000alow 40s, Augenthaler said.\u000a    Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste\u000amanagement concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the\u000aannouncment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90\u000adlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.\u000a    In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management\u000abusiness holds significant growth potential. The industry has\u000agrown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on\u000aearnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder\u000aPeabody and Co.

"On the one hand\u000ait's probably a cheap price.

He\u000awould not comment on the new offer.\u000a    Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as\u000adisk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to\u000aretailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to\u000aconsumers by cable television.\u000a    In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to\u000a87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year.

A preliminary\u000ainjunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until\u000athe case is decided.\u000a    Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr\u000abuyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS>, one dlr per share\u000alower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens\u000alast week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens\u000aoffer.\u000a    Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and\u000aDominion used illegally obtained confidential information about\u000athe company in making their takeover attempt.\u000a \u000a    That information, Burlington said, was provided by James\u000aAmmeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber\u000aGroup Inc <PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23\u000ayears, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's\u000asales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,\u000a1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to\u000adivulge inside information about the company.\u000a    Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began\u000aworking with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to\u000a"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its\u000amanagement," Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.\u000a    Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from\u000aPaineWebber, but argued the information was public information\u000aand could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or\u000aBurlington's public financial statements.\u000a    Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with\u000aEdelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with\u000athem until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went\u000apublic April 24 with their intention to take over the company.\u000aBurlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a\u000atakeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in\u000aFebruary.\u000a    Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held\u000adiscussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as\u000afinancial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off\u000abecause Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and\u000adominion with a written statement that they did not provide\u000ainside information.\u000a    Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen\u000awithdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman\u000aFrank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and\u000athreatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an\u000aeffort to takeover Burlilgnton.\u000a    "The ultimate question is not the price per share or the\u000aprofit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for\u000athose who would takeover an American company," said burlington\u000alawyer Humphrey.\u000a    Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the\u000alargest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in\u000aviolation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's\u000alargest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants\u000ain Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,\u000athe lawyers said.\u000a    Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the\u000amarket for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends\u000aand that Burlington has the ability to switch between light\u000aweight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price\u000adictate.\u000a    Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by\u000aBurlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid\u000afor Dominion.

After the trade\u000adata are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and\u000a140 yen."\u000a    Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York\u000awarned, "I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."\u000a    Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada\u000asaid market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of\u000athe U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.\u000a    Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction\u000ato the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,\u000awhich is likely to focus on the implementation of previous\u000acommitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.\u000a    President Reagan said today, "economic policy decisions\u000amade last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of\u000aSeven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be\u000aignored or forgotten."\u000a    "The commitments made at these meetings need to be\u000atranslated into action," he added in a speech, celebrating the\u000a40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.\u000a    Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,\u000aanalysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the\u000abrunt of U.S. calls for further action.\u000a    Marine Midland's O'Neill said, "pressure will build up on\u000aGermany to take stimulative action like Japan."\u000a    Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar\u000acould hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come\u000aunder attack again if it seems the latest economic package is\u000anot having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade\u000asurplus.

a(VVenezuela's central bank has ordered\u000aVenezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange\u000aoperations with brokers based outside the country, according to\u000aa copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.\u000a    The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has\u000aeffectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's\u000avolatile currency market.\u000a    The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez\u000aDelfino, manager of the bank's department of international\u000aoperations.\u000a    The telex said the restriction on business with foreign\u000abrokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign\u000aexchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign\u000acurrencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.\u000a    In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied\u000arumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to\u000aprop up the weakening bolivar.\u000a    But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de\u000afacto currency control. "It is definitely a control in the sense\u000athat there's no longer complete freedom to operate," one broker\u000ahere said.\u000a    "Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction\u000ais towards complete control," the broker said.\u000a    The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his\u000aVenezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since\u000athe central bank issued the telex and followed it up with\u000atelephone calls.\u000a    He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume\u000aof his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs\u000aa day. "It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," he\u000asaid.\u000a    The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the\u000aprohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary\u000abetween Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.\u000a    "We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's\u000aridiculous," he said. "They've been on a rampage against\u000aforeigners."\u000a    The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central\u000abank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange\u000abusiness outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct\u000areserve requirement.\u000a    In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in\u000abolivar futures, the broker said.\u000a    "We used to have a forward market," he said. "For a small\u000acurrency it was miraculous."\u000a    He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.\u000aDollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range\u000aof 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running\u000aout of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free\u000amarket.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VBundesbank vice president Helmut\u000aSchlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.\u000a    With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in\u000aMay and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,\u000aSchlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a\u000afurther cut in interest rates was needed.\u000a    The economy is picking up, after contracting by a\u000aseasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from\u000athe fourth, he added. "We may have an increase in gnp starting\u000ain the second quarter," he said in an interview.\u000a    Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been\u000apressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its\u000aimports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.\u000a    Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was\u000amainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in\u000a1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.\u000a    He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole\u000awould probably be between one and two pct.\u000a   "It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic\u000ademand does not grow strongly," he said, noting that interest\u000arates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.\u000a    Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money\u000astock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace\u000aof 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six\u000apct target.\u000a    He said the target could still be achieved but much will\u000adepend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy\u000ainflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS\u000arevaluation, boosted domestic money supply.\u000a    "There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of\u000aforeign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit\u000areversed," Schlesinger said.\u000a    A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction\u000athat the mark was headed higher. "As we can see from the market,\u000aexpectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have\u000adiminished," Schlesinger said.\u000a    The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the\u000afact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period\u000aand an improvement in real trade balances have all combined\u000atowards stabilizing the dollar, he said.\u000a    Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar\u000arise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87\u000amarks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.\u000a    At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.\u000a    "Central banks are always in contact about these\u000afluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,"\u000aSchelsinger said.\u000a    "One has to look at how it (the market) is moving," he said,\u000aadding, "It is not only our own case, it is also the American\u000acase."\u000a    He said that the West German export industry has been hit\u000ahard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see\u000asome correction now. "But it wouldn't be good to have short-term\u000afluctuations," he said. "Let us wait and see."\u000a    "It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very\u000ashort period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level\u000a(of rates) as such," Schlesinger said.\u000a    The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of\u000asuch key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West\u000aGerman inflation down year.\u000a    Although there have recently been signs of inflation\u000apicking up, he said that this was due to changes in key\u000acommodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would\u000abe unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.\u000a    Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth\u000awas longer term, in that the economy was building up the\u000apotential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.\u000a    The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16\u000amonths had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of\u000atargets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the\u000amid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.\u000a    But he added: "I don't see any great pressure to go away\u000afrom it."\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VDeregulation of Japan's oil industry could\u000amean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into\u000abigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.\u000a    They said the relaxation of controls was now under review\u000aby the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of\u000aInternational Trade and Industry (MITI).\u000a    A spokesman for a major firm said, "Deregulation would bring\u000aabout a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer\u000acompetition, we have no choice but to accept it."\u000a    The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.\u000a    The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it\u000ashould end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It\u000ashould cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of\u000acurrent capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and\u000agasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.\u000a    They said deregulation was vital to promote more\u000acompetition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.\u000a    "Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn\u000ato see if we can survive cut-throat competition," said a source\u000aat one major Japanese oil company.\u000a    A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, "We'll have a hard\u000atime surviving, but that's something we must go through."\u000a    "In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for\u000athe oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out\u000afurther into other lines such as real estate and travel\u000aagencies," he said.\u000a    Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd\u000awhich had the largest share of refined products sales in the\u000aJapanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining\u000acapacity in fiscal 1986.\u000a    Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products\u000ain 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a\u000aspokesman for the company said.\u000a    Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the\u000aCouncil, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies\u000awithin seven refining and marketing groups to improve the\u000aefficiency of the industry.\u000a    Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to\u000abe streamlined further into five refining groups.\u000a    "MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to\u000amerge into five to build up their muscles," a source said.\u000a    A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the\u000apossibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry\u000ain the event of the relaxation of oil controls.\u000a    He declined to officially confirm or deny that the\u000aPetroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but\u000asaid that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards\u000aderegulation.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VThe Philippines' first quarter growth\u000afigures released yesterday indicated the government was likely\u000ato achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose\u000aFernandez said in an interview.\u000a    The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)\u000aannounced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct\u000aand gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter\u000afrom a year earlier.\u000a    "I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it\u000a(growth) short," Fernandez said.\u000a     NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the\u000afourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP\u000agrowth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.\u000a    "Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources\u000aand if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that\u000adomestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and\u000awould not be a stumbling block," Fernandez said.\u000a    "I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at\u000akey indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,\u000ashowed that the economy was on a different track from last\u000ayear," he said.\u000a    Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the\u000afirst and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it\u000acould drop off in the third quarter.\u000a    He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the\u000amanufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in\u000a1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.\u000a    "That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular," he said.\u000a    He said the government had met all monetary targets set for\u000athe first quarter in consultation with the International\u000aMonetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth\u000atranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.\u000a    The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling\u000a58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.\u000aFernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or\u000aAugust to review performance in the January-June period.\u000a    He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion\u000adlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.\u000aRepayments were inevitable and many countries would find their\u000anet repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.\u000a    "It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA\u000a(official development assistance) accounts the commercial\u000abanking system will be requested to hold the line," he said.\u000a    It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF\u000adebt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.\u000a    The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28\u000abillion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.\u000a    Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984\u000ato mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in\u000aApril 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in\u000aOctober last year, had almost been completed.\u000a    He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level\u000atouched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.\u000a"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool," he said.\u000a    Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, "I\u000athink the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own\u000areceipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap\u000aforward as might have been suitable."\u000a    The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach\u000a29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.\u000a    NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first\u000aquarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.\u000a    Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of\u000abetween six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while\u000agrowth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.\u000a    Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some\u000aeconomists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the\u000adollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more\u000acompetitive.\u000a    "By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso\u000ahas already substantially devalued against all of the country's\u000atrading partners," he said.\u000a    On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was\u000aopposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted\u000arepatriation abroad of investments made during the first two\u000ayears after the imposition of the Code.\u000a    The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has\u000abeen delayed by objections from some business groups.\u000a    "I think any central bank, certainly this one after the\u000aevents of the past two or two and a half years, has to be\u000aprudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds\u000aand I'm not about to do that," Fernandez said.\u000a    "It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of\u000acapital and earnings can be free," he said.\u000a    "We have had one year of reasonably good results.

It is a purely technical\u000amatter," he added.\u000a    The West German government is expected to come under\u000apressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners\u000ato stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international\u000atrade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.\u000a    However, government officials have ruled out any further\u000atax reduction packages to supplement a major program of\u000astimulatory fiscal measures already underway.\u000a    Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German\u000acentral bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the\u000awidest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real\u000aterms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first\u000aquarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.\u000a     The government has confirmed that growth was negative in\u000athe first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to\u000abe about two pct.\u000a    Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to\u000acut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,\u000aat three pct, is just above historical lows.\u000a    West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice\u000asummit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,\u000ais already outstripping export performance, which has suffered\u000afrom an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over\u000atwo years.\u000a    The government has pointed out that depressed exports are\u000athe main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but\u000asays that later in the year stronger domestic demand will\u000acompensate for this setback.\u000a    It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under\u000atwo pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VFor currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is\u000athe scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has\u000aplayed a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for\u000athe last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the\u000amark.\u000a    President of the powerful and independent West German\u000acentral bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his\u000acontract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the\u000aend of this year, government officials say.\u000a    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)\u000a    But no official announcement has yet been made, raising\u000aeyebrows in West Germany's business community.\u000a    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top\u000aministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in\u000aopposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.\u000a    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl\u000awould try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own\u000aChristian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked\u000aclosely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard\u000aStoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.\u000a    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul\u000aVolcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international\u000areputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.\u000a    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook\u000aPoehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor\u000aWilly Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was\u000aFinance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as\u000aChancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.\u000a    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the\u000adollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of\u000athe Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution\u000awhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent\u000ainflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts\u000aof galloping inflation this century.\u000a    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and\u000ainflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe\u000ato relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the\u000adangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.\u000a    "I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the\u000adollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the\u000aBundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark\u000awould endanger the economy in West Germany," he told business\u000ajournalists in Frankfurt recently.\u000a    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that\u000aPoehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.\u000a    "Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not\u000afocus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external\u000aeconomy," she said.\u000a    An economist at a German bank, who declined to be\u000aidentified, said "If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will\u000acertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so\u000arigidly oriented towards money supply."\u000a    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to\u000apersuade the United States to stop "talking down" the dollar. For\u000aPoehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that\u000athe United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise\u000acurrencies.\u000a    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency\u000adealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in\u000afact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.\u000a    "This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they\u000adon't know - what the central banks can do," Poehl says of\u000aintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates\u000around, making a speculator's position worthless.\u000a    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist\u000ain the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.\u000a    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over\u000aa glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.\u000a    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and\u000aplay golf.\u000a    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute\u000afor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.\u000a    "But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount\u000aif you strike at the right moment," he said. Bundesbank dealers\u000aare very professional and skilled. "They've burnt the fingers of\u000amany people," he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,\u000athe Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.\u000a REUTER\u000a

It said 1986\u000aplantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because\u000afarmers could earn more from other crops and because technical\u000aand seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.\u000a    The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop\u000a(November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year\u000aearlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.\u000a    The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500\u000atonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier\u000afigure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China\u000aNews Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.\u000a    The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province\u000afell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the\u000aarea under sugar was dropping.\u000a    "Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate," the newspaper\u000asaid. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of\u000anearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane\u000ais a major problem."\u000a    A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,\u000asouth China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in\u000aarea planted.\u000a    He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel\u000adeveloped, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the\u000amaximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.\u000a    The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province\u000aof Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667\u000ahectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only\u000a70 from one mu of sugarbeet.\u000a    The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to\u000a4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.\u000a    Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed\u000awith each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in\u000afalling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.\u000a    The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the\u000aofficial press has said.\u000a    Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of\u000asugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.\u000a    The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln\u000atonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.\u000a    A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks\u000ain 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import\u000asugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986\u000awhen the central government resumed control of imports.\u000a    "As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored\u000ain Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas," the diplomat\u000asaid.\u000a    The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to\u000aconsumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly\u000aas coal had priority. "How quickly they can move the sugar is\u000aone factor determining import levels," he said.\u000a    Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,\u000aChina's major supplier through barter trade, he said.\u000a    "China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about\u000a152/153 dlrs a tonne," he added. "China is not a desperate buyer\u000anow. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into\u000athe open market."\u000a    A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding\u000aimports was price.\u000a    "While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,\u000aforeign exchange restraints persist," he said.\u000a    The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five\u000apct a year but "a communist government is in a much better\u000aposition to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the\u000aforeign exchange situation demands it."\u000a REUTER\u000a

They\u000aadded that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge\u000aof the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend\u000aforeign exchange to importers and exporters.\u000a    Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks\u000areached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,\u000aaccording to official statistics.\u000a    Last week the central bank said that from today it would\u000areduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40\u000apct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move\u000awas needed because of "distortions" in the foreign exchange\u000amarket.\u000a    Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,\u000ahave been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank\u000amarket to avoid exchange rate losses.\u000a    Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May\u000areached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9\u000abillion in April.\u000a    All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted\u000ainto local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming\u000aexports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in\u000athe year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.\u000a    In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on\u000aremittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to\u000aTaiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.\u000a    Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of\u000athe local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of\u000aspeculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has\u000aflowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..\u000a    Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about\u000a22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.\u000a    Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the\u000aforeign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on\u000acapital outflows.

a(VThe World Bank's policies prevent it from\u000alending money for the transfer of land from landowners to the\u000alandless, but it can help finance development of the\u000aPhilippines' proposed land reform program, a bank official\u000asaid.\u000a    "The World Bank by its established policies cannot use its\u000aresources to finance the transfer of assets from one group to\u000aanother. Our mandate is to finance investment-related\u000aactivities," Rolando Arrivillaga, the bank's resident\u000arepresentative in the Philippines, told Reuters in an\u000ainterview.\u000a    Arrivillaga said he wanted to clarify part of a report by a\u000aWorld Bank mission that came in March to review the land reform\u000aprogram and which said the bank would not be able to finance\u000acompensation payments for the transfer of land.\u000a    He said the Philippine government had never asked the bank\u000ato finance land transfers, and the bank's position should not\u000abe taken to mean that it ruled out any lending for the program.\u000a    "Clearly in the case of land reform the question of land\u000atransfer by definition is transferring assets from the landed\u000ato the landless," Arrivillaga said. "However, the bank as an\u000ainstitution can finance the development aspects of the program."\u000a    "We will deal with the part of the program that deals with\u000ahow to put the land to effective use once it has been\u000atransferred and how to make the on-farm investments that are\u000aneeded to attain the goal of improving the income level of the\u000abeneficiaries," Arrivillaga said.\u000a    "I wouldn't be surprised if other multilateral institutions\u000aare faced with similar constraints," he said.\u000a    President Corazon Aquino's spokesman said last week that\u000ashe was committed to launching the program, which limits land\u000aholdings to seven hectares, by using her sweeping powers of\u000arule by decree before a new Congress convenes in July.\u000a    Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said the land reform\u000aprogram, estimated to cost about 44 billion pesos, would be\u000aimplemented in four phases and benefit 2.64 mln farmers.\u000a    Benigno said the first two phases would complete the\u000atransfer of rice and corn lands and abandoned farmland as well\u000aas the transfer of land sequestered, expropriated or foreclosed\u000aby the government and would cover 1.15 mln hectares.\u000a    But Aquino would not decree the redistribution of large\u000asugar, banana and coconut plantations, leaving it to the\u000aCongress to work out the details, Benigno said.\u000a    Arrivillaga said bilateral aid donors, who form part of a\u000aconsultative group led by the World Bank, might be prepared to\u000afinance the land transfers.\u000a    "I don't think there are fast and easy rules as to how\u000ainternational sources of finance would behave in a situation\u000alike this, because land reform by its very nature requires rich\u000afinancing to be able to carry out the reform in a way equitable\u000ato both the landowner and the beneficiary," he said.\u000a    Arrivillaga said the first priority for the government\u000awould be to tap domestic sources of financing for the land\u000atransfer, but external assistance could be brought in if there\u000awere gaps.\u000a    "In such a fundamental reform the test of the willingness of\u000athe government is how it confronts the domestic resource\u000arequirement," Arrivillaga said. "Multilateral agencies by their\u000avery nature are lenders of last resort. It means they have to\u000abe convinced that the government prioritises the program."\u000a    He said the World Bank had financed developmental costs\u000aunder an earlier land reform program launched by former\u000aPresident Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, and such aid had been\u000achannelled through the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).\u000a    The LBP is the main implementing agency under Aquino's\u000aprogram.\u000a    "If asked to do so again and the program is designed to\u000aimprove the standard of living of the poor then we would\u000acertainly be prepared to consider (lending)," Arrivillaga said.\u000a    He said the tendency in such programs was to exaggerate the\u000acosts by presenting ten-year perspectives in a one-year\u000acontext.\u000a    Arrivillaga said the government could solve most of its\u000afinancing problems by devising effective instruments to\u000acompensate landowners.\u000a    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said landowners are\u000alikely to be paid 10 pct in cash and the rest in 10-year bonds\u000awith 10 pct of their face value redeemable each year.\u000a    Arrivillaga said any instruments used to compensate\u000alandowners had to be freely tradable at near face value and\u000aadded: "The challenge is to devise a system of deferred payments\u000athat is as good as cash."\u000a    He said the international financing community was watching\u000athe Philippine experiment with great interest.\u000a    "They are going to be an interesting model for many other\u000acountries because they opened a dialogue on the reforms to\u000aevery sector of the population and even international\u000ainstitutions," he said.

a(VThe record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.\u000aReserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a\u000afurther cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11\u000ageneral election, market analysts said.\u000a    Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected\u000anumber but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.\u000a    But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now\u000aavailable to the authorities to support the pound should curb\u000aany market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the\u000aruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.\u000a    "We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than\u000awe have done hitherto," Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\u000asaid at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the\u000arecord reserves rise.\u000a    He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre\u000aaccord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the\u000adollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign\u000aexchanges. "We have been playing a very full part ourselves," he\u000asaid.\u000a    But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on\u000asterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down\u000aits rise, more in the light of local factors.\u000a    Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,\u000asaid that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain\u000aamid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last\u000aautumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.\u000a    U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign\u000abuyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as\u000aattractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably\u000aequities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.\u000a    Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower\u000ainterest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse\u000athe loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.\u000a    Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves\u000anews, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of\u000acurrencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0\u000apct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.\u000a    "The market doesn't want to do anything because of the\u000aelection," commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.\u000a    Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of\u000aa rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had\u000aoverestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to\u000ahave been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the\u000aforward market.\u000a    The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of\u000asterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth\u000athe pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention\u000areported in May probably occurred in April, they said.\u000a    The key three months interbank money market rates eased\u000aabout 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend\u000ain U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves\u000anews, analysts said.\u000a    Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was\u000amuted as traders worried about the funding implications of\u000aanother huge rise in reserves, they added.\u000a    Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut\u000afrom the current nine pct level soon after the election, so\u000along as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove\u000aaccurate, with another half point later.\u000a    Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse\u000aBuckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be\u000apossible. "Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in\u000afuture, rather than this active intervention," he predicted.\u000a    Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned\u000aagainst over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut\u000alooked likely.\u000a    A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.\u000a    "The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political\u000aproblem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And\u000ahas signalled some worry about broad money (growth)," said Robin\u000aMarshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.\u000a    He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in\u000athe past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the\u000aEuropean Monetary System.\u000a    But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10\u000aor 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did\u000aso. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VSouth Africa is expected to unveil\u000atomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year\u000ain a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,\u000aeconomic analysts said.\u000a    Faced with competing demands for increased military and\u000apolice spending and the pressing need for more funds for black\u000ahousing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is\u000aexpected to raise significantly the government's overall\u000aexpenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,\u000athe analysts said.\u000a    Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state\u000aspending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the\u000afinancial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas\u000afrom the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.\u000a    "Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but\u000asimply raising government spending and increasing the budget\u000adeficit is an inflationary form of stimulation," said Rob Lee,\u000achief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.\u000a    South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted\u000agrowth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of\u000aless than one pct.\u000a    Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5\u000apct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to\u000aover 30 pct.\u000a    Economists estimate that the government's spending target\u000awill rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at\u000aaround 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit\u000abefore borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of\u000aGDP.\u000a    The government, having consistently overshot its own\u000aspending targets for more than a decade, also faces a\u000acredibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the\u000abudget, analysts said.\u000a    "The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,"\u000asaid Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.\u000a    Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less\u000aattention to the figures presented in the budget and are using\u000atheir own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the\u000amoney and capital markets.\u000a    South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending\u000awill again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49\u000abillion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5\u000apct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the\u000aIMF.\u000a    "The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned," predicted\u000aone analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away\u000afrom austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past\u000atwo years.\u000a    The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the\u000apolitical situation and the onset of an economic crisis\u000atriggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over\u000aloans to the country in September 1985.\u000a    Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling\u000aper capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,\u000agovernment officials say economic growth is the prime\u000aobjective.\u000a    But private-sector economists caution that the government's\u000aability to promote growth by boosting state spending is\u000aconstrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the\u000acurrent account of the country's balance of payments.\u000a    Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5\u000abillion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the\u000anation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an\u000aarrangement reached earlier this year with major international\u000acreditor banks.\u000a    Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has\u000alittle room to manoeuvre.\u000a    Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and\u000abudgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and\u000aSouth African Transport Services suggest that major tax\u000aconcessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.\u000a    Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions\u000afor taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only\u000aelection. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.\u000a    "This will not be a very exciting budget," commented Harry\u000aSchwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive\u000aFederal Party. "I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the\u000asweets were given out before the election."\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VThe World Bank, in the throes of a\u000apainful reorganization, faces new strains because of actions by\u000aCitibank and others to set aside new Latin debt reserves,\u000afinancial analysts and monetary sources said.\u000a    The monetary sources said the reorganization has caused\u000asome bad feelings and charges that promotions and other\u000apersonnel actions have been based on personality rather than\u000aability. It also had some effect in undermining the Bank's role\u000ain the global debt strategy, the sources said.\u000a    At the center of the controversy is Bank President Barber\u000aConable, whose reorganization efforts are getting some \u000acritical review from many Bank staff members and some member-\u000acountries including the United States.\u000a    "I think if he were to do it again, he would do it very\u000adifferently," said one source.\u000a    Conable, a former congressman from New York appointed by\u000aPresident Reagan to the senior most position at the Bank nearly\u000aa year ago, has taken the view that the Bank badly needed to be\u000areorganized and perhaps made more streamlined.\u000a    In this he had the backing of many in the Reagan\u000aadministration who viewed the Bank as a bloated and inefficient\u000abureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free-market\u000asources of assistance were available.\u000a    However, the Bank had been singled out for a much greater\u000arole under the U.S. debt initiative proposed by Treasury\u000aSecretary James Baker.  That strategy, which called for some 20\u000abillion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and nine\u000abillion dlrs in spending from the development banks, mostly the\u000aWorld Bank, came under profound doubt with the decision by\u000aCitibank and Chase Manhattan to set aside new reserves.\u000a    This move, heralded by some sources as a measure that gives\u000aall parties more time, frightened others, who see it as the\u000abeginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to complete\u000aunraveling of the monetary system.\u000a    As envisioned by the latter, the next move would be for\u000aBrazil, which has delayed payments on its debts, to say it does\u000anot intend to pay interest for a very long period of time.\u000a    Citibank and other banks could then decide to stop\u000afinancing the country's export credits, the funds countries use\u000ato support their daily activities, leading to an economic\u000abreakdown.\u000a    "Within six weeks alot of countries could be out of\u000abusiness," said one source.\u000a    Citibank's initial step last month was to set some three\u000abillion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loans\u000ato developing countries.  It was followed by a similar move by\u000aChase Manhattan some days later.\u000a    In the best of all worlds, the kind of cooperation that was\u000ademonstrated between the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the\u000amultilateral development banks, the wealthy countries and\u000acommercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in 1982, could\u000aemerge again but no one is expecting that.\u000a    If anything, the negotiations have become much more\u000aconfrontational with the debtor countries pressing for more\u000aconcessions, arguing that they face growing political\u000ainstability if they are asked to do or pay more.\u000a    They are very critical of the IMF's austerity measures and\u000athere is sympathy for their view among the development\u000acommunity.\u000a    "When you hear code words like structural adjustment and\u000atightening your belt.  What that means is that the poor peasent\u000amaking 700 dlrs a year should drop it to 500 dlrs," says one\u000asource.\u000a    He adds: "And when your hear they should have market forces\u000aat play, that means the level of public services should drop."\u000a    It had been hoped that giving the World Bank a greater role\u000ain the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in the\u000adebtor countries to measures that increased already prevalent\u000apoverty even further.\u000a   The Bank, which primarily assists countries in the building\u000aof roads, sewerage systems, education, and other so-called\u000ainfrastructure, is viewed in the Third World as benefactor.\u000a   The IMF, however, which essentially forged the debt stategy\u000afollowing the disclosure by Mexico in 1982 that it was near\u000adefault, is considered a stern taskmaster that has little\u000asympathy or even understanding of poverty.\u000a    But there are doubts about how well the Baker initiative\u000ahas worked and about the World Bank's success at bringing about\u000aincreased growth in the Third World under the U.S. prescription\u000awhich indicated that countries might grow their way out of\u000atheir difficulty.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VThe Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven\u000afinance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies\u000ahas worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the\u000aeconomic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the\u000aExchequer Nigel Lawson said.\u000a    Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce\u000aany major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work\u000aremained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting\u000aworld economic growth.side measures to boost growth, he said.\u000a\u000a    "I think it is possible that there may be scope for a\u000afurther reduction in interest rates in Germany," he added, but\u000astressed that he had had no indication that such a move was\u000alikely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.\u000a    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on "a gradual reduction\u000aof its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."\u000a    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced\u000a"satisfactory exchange rate stability," in part thanks to heavy\u000acoordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and\u000ahe was "content" with sterling's exchange rate.\u000a    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May\u000acurrency reserves announced today he said, "we have been playing\u000aa very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a\u000avery much greater extent than we had done hitherto."\u000a    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may\u000afalter if member states did not implement the macro-economic\u000acommitments underlying the accord.\u000a    "Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange\u000arate stability if countries are seen not to implement their\u000acommitments in Paris ... In this respect." He said the U.S.\u000aBudget deficit was "very important."\u000a    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by\u000aJapanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson\u000asaid, "what is really needed in Japan is an increase in\u000amerchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."\u000a    "There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural\u000agoods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is\u000awholly unjustified," he said.\u000a    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in "Japan\u000abashing" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation\u000apackage and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase\u000aJapanese development aid over the next three years.\u000a    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange\u000amembership would also help deflect criticism, he said.\u000a    He said he thought West Germany would instead come under\u000apressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to\u000ajack up faltering economic growth.\u000a    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring\u000aforward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts\u000ascheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with\u000athe privatisation of German national industries.\u000a    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan\u000ato alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to\u000amake progress in Venice.\u000a    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign\u000adebt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World\u000aBank meetings in Washington earlier this year.\u000a    Lawson said he would seek "to consolidate political backing\u000afor the plan at the Venice summit" and hoped the programme would\u000abe finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.\u000a    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase\u000aManhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt\u000aprovisions.\u000a    "First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market\u000aresponse has shown that banks have much less to fear from this\u000asort of move than they felt before Citicorp," he said.\u000a    U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,\u000astrengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.\u000a"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,"\u000aLawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to\u000adetermine the appropriate size of provisions.\u000a    He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be\u000adiscussed at the summit.

a(VCSR Ltd <CSRA.S> intends to proceed with\u000aits planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd\u000a<MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from <Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>\u000a(ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.\u000a    ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's\u000aissued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.\u000aThis compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed\u000abid.\u000a    The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand\u000aentrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct\u000astake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.\u000a\u000a    Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, which holds\u000ajust under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and\u000ahad told CSR it is not a seller.\u000a    He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its\u000aoperations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up\u000aa strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.\u000a    The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with\u000aRedland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six\u000amonths of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the\u000asame period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.\u000a    CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.\u000a\u000a    ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond\u000adescribing it as a long term investment.\u000a    ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is\u000aa leader in building materials, Herbert said.\u000a    "We fit better with Monier," he said.\u000a    CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its\u000acore businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves\u000ainto energy several years ago.\u000a    Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert\u000asaid: "I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to\u000awonder if Monier is the main target."\u000a\u000a    Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a\u000ahigher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.\u000a    Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its\u000aoriginal bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.\u000a    The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on\u000ayesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign\u000ashareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review\u000aBoard (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.\u000a    Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely\u000ato accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge\u000athe respective values of ETL and CSR shares.\u000a\u000a    ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible\u000aacquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a\u000apossible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the\u000anegotiations foundered on the price.\u000a    Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not\u000athink ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid\u000aalthough Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.\u000a    "Redland is still in the driving seat," said Tim Cohen of\u000a<Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having\u000aCSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.\u000a    Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.\u000a\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VThe Bundesbank is unlikely to change\u000acredit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday\u000afor its last session before the Venice summit, banking\u000aeconomists and money market dealers said.\u000a    The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month\u000aby cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is\u000aunlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates\u000ain the near future, they said.\u000a    The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will\u000abe followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.\u000a    But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was\u000ausually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and\u000adid not necessarily herald any policy moves.\u000a    Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today\u000athere was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply\u000agrowth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was\u000astable against the mark.\u000a    Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has\u000aopened a representative office, that the West German economy\u000awas now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted\u000a1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.\u000a    Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in\u000aa 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the\u000aBundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a\u000aminimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.\u000a    "They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe\u000alower market rates even further, but not with the discount or\u000aLombard," Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,\u000aMunchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.\u000a    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said\u000aGerman rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and\u000aaround historical lows for West Germany.\u000a    A further cut in rates would have little impact on the\u000aeconomy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,\u000awith companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.\u000a    The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move\u000aon interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.\u000a"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder," he said.\u000a    A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in\u000aline with the new structure of money market rates since last\u000amonth, would have little practical significance, dealers said.\u000a    The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a\u000adiplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.\u000a    But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it\u000aclear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere "eyewash."\u000a    Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to\u000acut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary\u000apolicy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.\u000a    But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax\u000acuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget\u000adeficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.\u000a    "The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in\u000aVenice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,"\u000asaid Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.\u000a    Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before\u000aVenice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. "But I\u000adon't expect any convincing measures," he said.\u000a    Money market dealers noted that call money continued to\u000anormalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday\u000aand as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by\u000amonth-end distortions.\u000a    Call money could come under upwards pressure later this\u000amonth because of a major round of tax payments by banks on\u000abehalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.\u000aTwo public holidays that week could also distort the market.\u000a    Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds\u000atomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55\u000apct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,\u000aand to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.\u000a    But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would\u000aallocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not\u000arepresent a tightening of policy, however.\u000a    Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates\u000aat the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full\u000aallocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.\u000a    On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely\u000ato lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency\u000aUnit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.\u000a    Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement\u000aon this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the\u000aSaarland bordering France, and was twice under French\u000aoccupation this century.\u000a    But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come\u000athis week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still\u000ato be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be\u000atreated for minimum reserve purposes.\u000a REUTER\u000a

He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10\u000asuch newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23\u000adailies.\u000a    "There is really no end to the ones that are available," he\u000atold reporters, although he added that most remaining\u000aacquisition opportunities are in the U.S.\u000a    He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,\u000aof London, should become profitable in this year's fourth\u000aquarter.\u000a   \u000a    For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or\u000abetter, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and\u000aimproved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest\u000acirculation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian\u000adlrs last year.\u000a    Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told\u000areporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily\u000acirculation had risen by 25,000 since September to about\u000a1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new\u000aIndependent daily newspaper.\u000a   \u000a    Knight said The Independent was not affecting the\u000aTelegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation\u000aof other London quality dailies such as The Times and The\u000aGuardian.\u000a    Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post\u000a1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,\u000aincluding extraordinary gains from previous sales of\u000adiscontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54\u000adlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an\u000aextraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.\u000a   \u000a    Black told shareholders that first quarter operating\u000aearnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs\u000aagainst a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.\u000a    Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs\u000afrom 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily\u000aTelegraph revenues, he added.

Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly\u000adeal, he added.\u000a    "We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or\u000aabout a perfume company," he said. "We want a good basic\u000aindustrial company that will fit into our management\u000astructure," Durham said.\u000a   \u000a    During the interview, Durham and other executives also said\u000acontinued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to\u000ahigher prices for the metal.\u000a    "In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price\u000a(for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new\u000aprojects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,\u000awill continue to grow modestly," said executive vice president\u000aDouglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of\u000aproducing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50\u000acents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and\u000acorporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.\u000a    Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now\u000acompared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts\u000asaid.\u000a    Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been\u000afor almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.\u000a    He declined to project results for the second quarter or\u000ayear. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in\u000acopper prices in the last month will help results.\u000a    Durham said last month that the second quarter should match\u000athe first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln\u000adlrs or 49 cts a share.\u000a    First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,\u000areflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased\u000acopper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also\u000aacquired last year.\u000a    Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75\u000adlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.\u000a Reuter\u000a

"We supply and they (Japan)\u000abuy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want to\u000abuy more," he said.\u000a    Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limits\u000atotal Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.\u000aimports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expanding\u000aU.S. beef shipments to Japan.\u000a    The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavy\u000aJapanese foreign beef imports.

a(VPaul Volcker's resignation as Federal\u000aReserve Board chairman creates a serious leadership vacuum at a\u000atime of deep uncertainty about the future management of the\u000athird-world debt crisis, bankers said.\u000a    They said Volcker did more than any other official to hold\u000athe financial system together when Mexico halted interest\u000apayments in August 1982 and has played a central role ever\u000asince.\u000a    "Where is the leadership going to come from? Suddenly\u000athere's a terrible void," one New York banker said.\u000a    Volcker's expertise will be all the more sorely missed\u000abecause International Monetary Fund managing director Michel\u000aCamdessus is new to his job and Barber Conable is finding it\u000ahard to make a mark as World Bank president, bankers said.\u000a    Moreover, Volcker's successor, Alan Greenspan, has little\u000aexperience of international affairs and third world debt.\u000a    "Greenspan does not have the sensitivity to these issues\u000aand the sense of understanding of their complexity that Volcker\u000ahas. Volcker understands what motivates people outside the U.S.\u000aThat was in his gut. Greenspan just does not have the intuitive\u000afeeling," one banker said.\u000a    This banker, who has discussed debt questions with\u000aGreenspan, described his views as simplistic.\u000a    But Robert Hormats of Goldman, Sachs and Co said he was not\u000aworried by Greenspan's lack of international experience.\u000a    "People rush to judgment, but once they get to know\u000aGreenspan I'm sure they'll find him an excellent replacement,"\u000asaid Hormats, a former Administration official.\u000a    Anyone nominated to replace Volcker would have paled in the\u000ainitial comparison, Hormats said. "Volcker had the status of a\u000afinancial demigod and you can't attain that status overnight,"\u000ahe said.\u000a    One veteran debt rescheduler said Volcker, together with\u000athe Bank of England, deserves credit for keeping the banking\u000asystem intact after Mexico's default.\u000a    "If it hadn't been for him, the world would look a lot\u000adifferent now," he said. "Whether you agreed with him or not,\u000ahe has a superb grasp of ideas."\u000a    Certainly, not all bankers did agree all the time with\u000aVolcker. In particular, he was roundly criticized by some for\u000amore or less forcing them last September to grant Mexico\u000agenerous terms on its 77 billion dlr new-loan and debt\u000arescheduling agreement.\u000a    "Volcker lost a lot of credibility by overstepping the\u000abounds and pushing the package onto the banks," commented one\u000abanker who helped to negotiate the Mexican deal.\u000a    Another critic was Citicorp chairman John Reed, who said\u000athe 13/16 pct interest margin would deter some bank lenders and\u000athus delay Mexico's return to the voluntary markets.\u000a    It was a review of the fate of the Mexican deal - and of\u000aothers that followed it for Chile, Venezuela, the Philippines\u000aand Argentina - that helped to convince Reed that the debt\u000acrisis was not about to be solved and that Citicorp needed to\u000abolster its reserves in case some of the loans went bad.\u000a    "It certainly contributed to the general feeling of\u000amalaise," one Citicorp banker said in describing the impact of\u000athe Mexican package on the bank's decision to add three billion\u000adlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses.\u000a    That decision, since followed by Chase Manhattan and\u000aSecurity Pacific Corp, may profoundly alter the strategy of\u000acreditors and debtors alike for tackling the debt crisis.\u000a    But no one is sure what the impact will be. "It's very\u000adifficult for anyone to know which way the debt problem is\u000agoing, and with Volcker out of the picture it just adds to the\u000auncertainty," one banker said.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VJapanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct\u000ato 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a\u000ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.\u000a    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for\u000apoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef\u000acattle raising, Ministry officials said.\u000a    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87\u000aagainst 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were\u000a217,554 tonnes against 224,101.\u000a    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes\u000afrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.\u000a    The officials said corn imports rose because the world\u000asurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced\u000aChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in\u000a1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.\u000a    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87\u000afrom 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from\u000a18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due\u000ato poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as\u000aArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.\u000a    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and\u000athe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.\u000a    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from\u000aincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.\u000a    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against\u000a528,152 a year earlier.

The\u000abalance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the\u000aend of crushing."\u000a    Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an\u000aestimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)\u000afor the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.\u000aThe FDB rejected this request.\u000a    Ganilau said, however, "The bank is prepared to carefully\u000aconsider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of\u000ahardship on a case-by-case basis."\u000a    In response to a further demand that all soldiers be\u000aremoved from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army\u000awould restrict its presence in the cane areas.\u000a    He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to\u000aharvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions\u000ato hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the\u000acommencement of harvest.\u000a    Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had\u000aindicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,\u000ahe added.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VEuropean coffee traders and roasters\u000amay propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee\u000aOrganization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting\u000ahere this week, traders and officials told Reuters.\u000a    Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the\u000apossible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the\u000aworld's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the\u000anext two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.\u000a    "The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's\u000aattitude, and this compromise could be a solution, " one said.\u000a    However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,\u000awhich began here today and is to continue to the end of the\u000aweek, has revealed gaps in the European position on\u000are-introducing quotas.\u000a    Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against\u000are-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in\u000afavour with the single proviso that there had to be some\u000aformula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing\u000acountries.\u000a    The roasters said the positions were generally fairly\u000aclose, and problems with some Government officials.\u000a    Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized\u000aGovernment attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.\u000a    Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota\u000are-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.\u000a    "Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the\u000aend of the week to at least present a common European Community\u000a(EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the\u000aInternational Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July," one trader said.\u000a    "We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not\u000aonly the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"\u000aone official said.\u000a    "We have learned that we can live without the quotas that\u000awere suspended in February last year, but would prefer the\u000astability they can bring to the market as long as we do not\u000asimply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as\u000aquota allocation is concerned," he added.\u000a    Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the\u000alikelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly\u000apessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.\u000a    "Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the\u000aconsumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota\u000are-introduction, " he said.\u000a    "The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new\u000aBrazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least\u000anegotiable position of any of his predecessors," one trader\u000asaid.\u000a    "However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of\u000athe consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under\u000aa new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which\u000agives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota\u000ameeting in September," the official said.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VU.S. House and Senate budget\u000anegotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached\u000ayesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending\u000aon agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.\u000a    The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4\u000abillion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.\u000a    The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the\u000afarm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a\u000atotal of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.\u000a    The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture\u000acommittees with difficult choices on how to make changes in\u000aagriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets\u000awithout jeopardizing popular support payments, senior\u000aCongressional aides told Reuters.\u000a    Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find\u000athe budget savings.\u000a    Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains\u000asubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat\u000aand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs\u000aand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.\u000a    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has\u000asaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.\u000a    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to\u000abe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and\u000aa strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said\u000afreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major\u000agrain export competitors and would not achieve the budget\u000asavings Glickman claims.\u000a    Another area where Glickman and other have said budget\u000asavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,\u000aARP, levels for wheat and corn.\u000a    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand\u000awithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop\u000awheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30\u000apct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most\u000acommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.\u000a    Congressional sources said the only way to achieve\u000asignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost\u000athe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said\u000asingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as\u000aunfair to one commodity.\u000a    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most\u000alikely to eventually look for budget savings are some\u000atightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible \u000aadoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.\u000a    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion\u000abut not enough, they said.\u000a    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture\u000acommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on\u000aall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price\u000asupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to the\u000aGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.\u000a    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau\u000aFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VSome OPEC states are unhappy about the\u000aprices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose\u000agreat problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price\u000aand output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.\u000a    They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference\u000apresidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances\u000aabout price differentials making some of their crudes\u000auncompetitive.\u000a    There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that\u000aOPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,\u000ato correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.\u000a    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price\u000adifferentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market\u000asignals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.\u000a    "All OPEC members can make a good case for changing\u000adifferentials," said one analyst with a major oil company. "But\u000aat the end of the day, the attitude is going to be "leave well\u000aalone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."\u000a    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw\u000asales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished\u000acustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,\u000amarketing incentives have helped their sales.\u000a    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by\u000ameans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside\u000abetter priced grades in a "package."\u000a    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least\u000afor some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should\u000achange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for\u000afuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At\u000aits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed\u000aprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference\u000apoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985\u000awhen members offered discounts to attract customers.\u000a    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8\u000amln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter\u000aand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend\u000aor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.\u000a    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not\u000amirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr\u000atarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,\u000aanalysts say.\u000a    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one\u000anon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export\u000acrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.\u000aExtra heavy crudes were among those left out.\u000a    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil\u000aexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say\u000aonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at\u000aofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processing\u000aor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.\u000a    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,\u000awhen some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to\u000apay the new prices.\u000a   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude\u000a-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --\u000awas uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.\u000a    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below\u000aits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,\u000adue partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has\u000arisen.\u000a    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say\u000aits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.\u000a    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort\u000aGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the\u000adifferentials question in Vienna.\u000a    "It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which\u000aholds the presidency, raised the issue," he said.\u000a REUTER\u000a

But none predicted a surplus.\u000a    The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and\u000athe foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,\u000athe New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite\u000alower interest rates, as overseas investors became more\u000aconfident about investing in New Zealand, he said.\u000a    However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying\u000athe local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will\u000amove lower.\u000a    The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after\u000ahours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget\u000arelease.\u000a    Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share\u000amarket, despite an increase in the contribution of company\u000ataxation to revenue figures.\u000a    One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus\u000aannouncement could push the share market up by 50 points\u000atomorrow.\u000a    The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a\u000acontinuation of existing policies, and the absence of\u000atraditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively\u000aby overseas investors, another said.\u000a    But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax\u000aavoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share\u000amarket, particularly multi-national companies.\u000a    The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,\u000athrough bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The\u000arequirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln\u000aN.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.\u000a    Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and\u000athere appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another\u000aeconomist said. He added that the document seemed entirely\u000acredible.\u000a    "Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,"\u000ahe said.\u000a    An election is due before the end of September.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VToday's U.K. Economic data have pushed\u000athe chances of another base lending rate cut from the current\u000anine pct further into the distance, analysts said.\u000a    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing\u000aproduction data showed that the economy is still strong and\u000adoes not need a fillip from lower rates.\u000a    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,\u000ataken together with higher than expected bank lending and money\u000asupply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist\u000aarguments against easier credit, they said.\u000a    "The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back\u000aall the while. The strength of the economy and broad money\u000agrowth are making it more difficult to see one in the near\u000aterm," said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.\u000a    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's\u000amortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies\u000asaid were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.\u000aRates.\u000a    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that\u000aa post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such\u000aoptimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which\u000amirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's\u000astrength.\u000a    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm\u000aabout May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment\u000arate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly\u000areplaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying\u000aaverage earnings in April, dealers said.\u000a    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending\u000arose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank\u000aof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset\u000athe impact on domestic money supply of its current\u000aintervention.\u000a    "The gilt market reaction was correct," said Bill Martin,\u000achief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.\u000a    "That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very\u000agood state indeed," Skeoch said.\u000a    "There's no reason to get worries about inflationary\u000apressures because they're very subdued." Unit wage cost rises\u000awere better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to\u000aApril, and it was these costs rather than average earnings\u000awhich were potentially inflationary, he added.\u000a    "I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major\u000aproblem," agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.\u000a    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried\u000aabout the funding implications of recent intervention.\u000a    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets\u000aearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that\u000athe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now\u000alooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try\u000ato prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.\u000a    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson\u000aSecurities, said any fresh sterling strength would still\u000atrigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal\u000ahigher inflation this year.\u000a    "Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As\u000along as that continues we're okay," he added.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VA spokesman for the European\u000aCommunity Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy\u000aon oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help\u000aalleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.\u000a    Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's\u000aDirectorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils\u000aand Fats Contact Days "the Commission firmly believes that the\u000asacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in\u000athe oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to\u000amake an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem\u000awithin that sector by paying a levy."\u000a    The proposed tax is necessary because the level of\u000abudgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds\u000aproduction has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.\u000a    Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European\u000aCurrency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0\u000abillion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's "standstill"\u000aagreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then\u000afeel the full impact of its enlargement.\u000a    The Commission has proposed several cost and production\u000acutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum\u000aguaranteed quantity system, he added.\u000a    Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer\u000aprices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700\u000aEcus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe\u000asaid.\u000a    Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory\u000aamount when market prices are below or above this level.\u000a    He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory\u000aamount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural\u000aPolicy's oils and fats regime.\u000a    "The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the\u000aproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete\u000aor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal," he said.\u000a    Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General\u000aAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.\u000a    It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied\u000ato domestic and imported products, and past experience showed\u000ait would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.\u000a    EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do\u000aunder present aid arrangements, he said.\u000a    The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC\u000aproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities\u000aimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,\u000aTanghe said.\u000a    The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'\u000arequirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall\u000aeffect would stabilise Community production levels without\u000aaffecting demand, he said.\u000a    It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current\u000aimport levels, he said.\u000a    Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are\u000aimported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals\u000arequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.\u000aFurthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported\u000abeans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.\u000a Reuter\u000a

Mining\u000ais monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the\u000acountry's foreign exchange earnings.\u000a    Production has also been seriously affected in recent years\u000aby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of\u000aspare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output\u000alast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.\u000a    A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984\u000aby ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African\u000aDevelopment Bank and the World Bank.\u000a    The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and\u000ametallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.\u000a    ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has\u000asaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as\u000apart of the plan.\u000a    More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the\u000aindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under\u000athe five-year restructuring plan.\u000a    Company officials said although reserves were being\u000adepleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the\u000aend of the century, though at lower levels of production.\u000a    Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for\u000athe financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln\u000akwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being\u000alevied, a net loss is likely to be registered.\u000a    ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared\u000awith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.\u000a    Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in\u000a1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as\u000athe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over\u000atwo to the dollar.\u000a    But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the\u000aauctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,\u000aand announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic\u000astrategy based on national resources.\u000a    ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the\u000abreak with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.\u000a    "We are still consulting to see how the new measures will\u000aaffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare\u000aunder the new situation," Peter Hansen, director of operations\u000aand third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.\u000a    Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange\u000arate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export\u000aprofits.\u000a    "Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even\u000apoint for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar," Frederick\u000aChiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.\u000a    High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian\u000aindustry.\u000a    Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69\u000acents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States\u000aand under 40 cents in Chile.\u000a    The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia\u000abeing landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had\u000astopped sBending copper south through South Africa.\u000a    Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are\u000asent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while\u000a5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.\u000aTransport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and\u000afuel.\u000a Reuter\u000a

"All we ask is\u000afor our companies to be given similar opportunities," he added.\u000a    If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair\u000asubsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be\u000asurprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures,\u000aYounger said.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VRonald Perelman, head of Revlon Group\u000aInc <REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette\u000aCo that could draw some big international players and in the\u000aprocess make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts\u000asaid.\u000a    Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of\u000adirectors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested\u000aconsent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per\u000ashare. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in\u000aNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.\u000a    "I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and\u000amore interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands\u000ato make a ton of money," said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson\u000aLehman Brothers Inc. "In play" is a term used on Wall Street to\u000adescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling\u000atakeover target.\u000a    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon\u000agets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through\u000aNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per\u000ashare. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of\u000athree yesterday.\u000a    The agreement would be calculated on the basis of\u000aPerelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a\u000asplit. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other\u000acompany at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262\u000amln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen\u000areturned telephone calls seeking comment.\u000a    "Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if\u000asomeone else takes over Gillette," said Analyst Deepak Raj of\u000aMerrill Lynch and Co. "I'm not saying that is going to happen\u000abut Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45\u000adlrs per share."\u000a    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons\u000awhy Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring\u000aGillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon\u000aprivate after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two\u000ayears ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's\u000aoperations. "He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of\u000athe dearptment store business." Another reason is that Revlon\u000ahas recently made two other acquisitions.\u000a    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if\u000asome company such as Unilever plc <UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble\u000aCo <PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.\u000a    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for\u000aGillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc <HAN>,\u000aRJR Nabisco Inc <RJR>, American Brands Inc <AMB> and Ralston\u000aPurina Co <RAL>.\u000a    "Perelman is trying to put the company in play," said a\u000aWall Street arbitrageur. "He gets to share in the upside if the\u000acompany is sold." Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette\u000ato resist Perelman's overture. "I can't see the board\u000aconsenting, what has changed between November and now," he\u000asaid.\u000a   \u000a    Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.\u000a"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of\u000acalculation," he said. But he added, "The Gillette board has to\u000abe careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by\u000ashareholders." Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,\u000athree and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.\u000a    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by\u000aGillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger\u000aagreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank\u000aN.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial\u000aadviser.\u000a Reuter\u000a

Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs\u000afor wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.\u000a    Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market\u000asharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting\u000anations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the\u000afirst of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings\u000aexamining farm programs.\u000a    Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his\u000a"Family Farm Act."\u000a    -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income\u000aand reduce government spending on agriculture.\u000a    -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not\u000aruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would\u000aincrease overall revenue from exports.\u000a    This would be done by seeking agreement among major\u000aexporting countries including the European Community on market\u000asharing at agreed high prices.\u000a    Sen.

a(VJapan's trade surplus is likely to\u000acontinue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad\u000aincrease while domestic demand remains sluggish, the\u000aOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\u000asaid.\u000a    In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the\u000aOECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last\u000ayear, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while\u000aexport markets rose by only two pct.\u000a    But it said this differential between the growth of\u000adomestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,\u000a"thus weakening the international adjustment process."\u000a    It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two\u000apct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct\u000ain 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will\u000arise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in\u000a1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.\u000a    The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion\u000ayen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand\u000aand increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the\u000ameasures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite\u000apossibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have\u000aworked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.\u000a    The OECD outlook said, "Continued large current account\u000asurpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial\u000anet external asset position could well lead to upward pressure\u000aon the yen." It said that further appreciation could then lead\u000amanufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus\u000aweaken domestic growth.\u000a    The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to\u000agorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct\u000agrowth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance\u000aon inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a\u000a0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.\u000a Reuter\u000a

Both fixed investment and private consumption\u000awere expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain\u000astrong.\u000a    The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply\u000anext year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European\u000aCommunity and declining competitiveness.\u000a    In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards\u000afollowing an increase early this year linked with the\u000aintroduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due\u000ato cold weather.\u000a REUTER\u000a

But inflation appears to be\u000aheading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer\u000aprices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next\u000ayear after just 2.1 pct in 1986.\u000a    "Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors\u000abehind the avoidance of recession," the report said.\u000a    The current account balance of payments deficit is expected\u000ato be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after\u000ahitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.\u000a    In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly\u000ato around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will\u000astill be below levels seen in recent years.

Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments\u000aimbalances are likely to persist," it said in one of its\u000agloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.\u000a    The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of\u000awestern industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only\u000a2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's\u000a2.5 pct growth rate.\u000a    "We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area\u000acomfortably exceeding three pct," David Henderson, head of the\u000aOECD's economics and statistics department, said.\u000a    The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising\u000ainflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,\u000aCombining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world\u000adebt problem to increase the risks of a world economic\u000adownturn.\u000a    "At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth\u000aremain favorable," it said, citing low inflation in most major\u000acountries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest\u000arates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible\u000alabor markets.\u000a    But private sector confidence had been undermined by\u000auncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that "for\u000aconfidence to be restored, it is important for governments\u000aswiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments."\u000a    This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord\u000aof the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.\u000a    The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major\u000acountries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to\u000aundermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal\u000apolicies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand\u000ain the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.\u000a    Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced\u000arecently by the Japanese government to encourage public works\u000aand cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this\u000aprocess, though it was too early to estimate its precise\u000aimpact.\u000a    He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic\u000ademand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.\u000a    The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has\u000aworsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast\u000ato rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct\u000aincrease in 1986.\u000a    There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the\u000aunemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the\u000aaverage rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last\u000ayear.\u000a    The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world\u000aagricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from\u000aprice guarantees and other measures linked to production\u000atowards direct income support for farmers.\u000a Reuter\u000a

Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs\u000ato 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.\u000a    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for\u000athe week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has\u000afallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,\u000aeconomists said.\u000a    "M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness," said Bill Sullivan\u000aof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\u000a    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of\u000aeconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned\u000athe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth\u000ain the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen\u000aas better gauges of economic growth.\u000a    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both\u000ameasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's\u000a5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.\u000a    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,\u000aconcerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,\u000acould turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.\u000a    "Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open\u000amarket position? No," Sullivan said. "But does this mean the end\u000aof tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."\u000a    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings\u000aof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period\u000awere lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had\u000atargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.\u000a    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day\u000anet miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher\u000aborrowings target would probably have been reached.\u000a    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in\u000aauto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,\u000awhile a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has\u000ahelped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.\u000a    "If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed\u000aeasing at some point," he said.\u000a    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little\u000aattention to weak money supply growth. "It has been a number of\u000ayears since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the\u000aeconomy," one said. "I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is\u000afalling apart and the Fed should ease."\u000a    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a\u000aprerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary\u000apolicy.\u000a    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates\u000afor fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and\u000ahigher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke\u000aoff econmomic growth.\u000a    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late\u000aApril. "The Fed has to determine if this represents a\u000afundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives\u000athem more room to ease," he said.\u000a REUTER\u000a

Last year, shipments were in three\u000aparcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.\u000a    CPC officials also said the company agreed with the\u000aEgyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of\u000aSuez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the\u000agovernment selling price.\u000a    Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through\u000aC.Itoh.\u000a    Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light\u000afrom Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several\u000aconstraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels\u000aand proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.\u000a    Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where\u000alifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC\u000athen proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.\u000a    CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for\u000adelivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to\u000aoffload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.\u000a    CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since\u000aDecember. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln\u000atonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot\u000amarket compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VMore U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers\u000afixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes\u000athe same monthly payment no matter what happens to other\u000ainterest rates.\u000a    And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in\u000ayears, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers\u000atrying to lock into cheap money.\u000a    The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials\u000asaid, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home\u000amortgage business.\u000a    While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They\u000awere the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a\u000afew years ago.\u000a    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,\u000amostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low\u000aas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their\u000aportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to\u000ainduce them to retain their accounts.\u000a    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were\u000aforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose\u000arates would move in line with the cost of funds.\u000a    "We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,"\u000asaid a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,\u000aexplaining why his institution, for the time being, is only\u000aoffering variable rate mortgages.\u000a    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped\u000ahomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders\u000aconcede they are being forced to undercut each other still\u000amore.\u000a    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier\u000athis week by the nation's two largest building societies and by\u000aNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for\u000anew business, officials at all three institutions said.\u000a    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even\u000abelow those on the variable rate loans.\u000a    "Of course they are less profitable than other (variable\u000arate) mortgages," said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which\u000aearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate\u000anew mortgage loans.\u000a    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable\u000aloans because, "It was just another way to attract people to our\u000amortgage product."\u000a    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed\u000arate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.\u000a    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was\u000aexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.\u000a    "Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage," she said, noting\u000athat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct\u000aof its 1986 volume.\u000a    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they\u000aoffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest\u000arates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the\u000alender is earning an above average return on assets.\u000a    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won\u000athe benefit of cheap money.\u000a    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed\u000arate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption\u000athat a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates\u000afall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.\u000a    Young explained that the company had planned to protect\u000aitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a\u000acomplicated hedging instrument.\u000a    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations\u000aand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He\u000asaid money market rates were too high to arrange both the\u000amortgages and hedge profitably.\u000a    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does\u000amake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This\u000ameans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond\u000aand selling them to an investor.\u000a    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more\u000aefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate\u000amortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular\u000aagain, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money\u000aover the past few years.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VU.S. crude oil prices are at their\u000ahighest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC\u000ameeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any\u000apolicy changes from the session.\u000a    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the\u000aorganization's accord in December, have risen on technical\u000afactors within the market and concerns about supplies because\u000aof the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the\u000aGulf.\u000a    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading\u000aaround 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile\u000aExchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its\u000ahighest level since January 1986.\u000a    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's\u000aoil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to\u000abe brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production\u000aagreement may only need a slight review.\u000a    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation\u000aof the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to\u000aa desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.\u000a    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon\u000aafter the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased\u000atension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices\u000ashould begin easing.\u000a    "OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed\u000ato in December because oil prices are firm," said John Hill, a\u000avice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.\u000a    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at\u000a18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to\u000a16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln\u000abarrels in the fourth quarter.\u000a    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising\u000afrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.\u000a    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,\u000aAlgeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a\u000areduction in output.\u000a    "And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to\u000atrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that\u000aOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price," said Nauman\u000aBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.\u000a    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such\u000aas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.\u000a    "The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the\u000aofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are\u000acommitted to stabilizing the market," said Rosario Ilacqua,\u000aanalyst with L.F. Rothschild.\u000a    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting\u000ain September to re-evaluate market conditions.\u000a    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the\u000afourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a\u000aday and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000\u000abarrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president\u000aof Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.\u000a    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this\u000ameeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to\u000aoffset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated\u000athroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,\u000aproducers receive less money for their oil.\u000a    "The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,"\u000asaid Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.\u000a    "In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to\u000aproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act\u000aas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two\u000adlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting," he\u000asaid.\u000a    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.\u000a    "The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian\u000aGulf," said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache\u000aSecurites.\u000a    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been\u000aregular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration\u000ais planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the\u000aU.S. flag, with naval escorts.\u000a    "Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis\u000alike this, and just general nervousness over an incident that\u000acould disrupt oil supplies drives prices up," Knuettel said.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VEuropean coffee roasters and traders\u000ahave agreed to propose a new formula for calculating\u000aInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee\u000aTrade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.\u000a    Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee\u000aFederation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.\u000a    The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and\u000awould give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an\u000aunchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current\u000acoffee agreement, van Horick said.\u000a    If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the\u000aICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new\u000aagreement, van Horick said.\u000a    Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when\u000aprices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in\u000aBrazil.\u000a    Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and\u000aproducers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.\u000a    "Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the\u000aformula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal\u000aleaves it very little to object to," van Horick said.\u000a    "The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not\u000areflect supply and demand reality," he said. "Our formula\u000abuilds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost\u000aeveryone."\u000a    Although full implications of the new formula have still to\u000abe worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as\u000aColombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly\u000ahigher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El\u000aSalvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.\u000a    Because the proposal provides that future quota\u000adistribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it\u000ashould also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing\u000aso would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.\u000a    "If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least\u000aa fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the\u000aSeptember meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a\u000anew quota formula, " van Horick said.\u000a    At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.\u000a    "Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If\u000athere is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two\u000amonths and most other producers favour our proposal, we might\u000ajust get an agreement," van Horick added.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VPresident Reagan's nominee as top\u000apoliceman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an\u000aagency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock\u000aprice gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the\u000aglobalization of financial markets.\u000a    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at\u000aNorthwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday\u000ato be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and\u000aExchange Commission.\u000a    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed\u000aJohn Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record\u000asix years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.\u000a    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its\u000ainvestigators have probed into the most colossal insider\u000atrading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.\u000a    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in\u000arecent months as a growing number of well known traders and\u000aprominent investment banking firms have been charged with\u000awrongdoing.\u000a    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after\u000aIvan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock\u000aspeculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators\u000aand to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal\u000aprofits after being charged with insider trading.\u000a    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new\u000aphenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by\u000acomputer-driven trading strategies that span markets in \u000asecurities, options and futures. The price gyrations have\u000acombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented\u000avolatility to some U.S. securities markets.\u000a    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some\u000alawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate\u000atakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers\u000asteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.\u000a    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign\u000aexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork\u000afor an international securities marketplace in which trading\u000aoccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.\u000a    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment\u000aopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce\u000aU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.\u000a    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial\u000adisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,\u000aeliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to\u000aspur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's\u000areview of hostile corporate takeovers.\u000a    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton\u000ainvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to\u000athe agency upon being named chairman in 1981.\u000a    In line with the views of other top administration\u000aofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover\u000abattles over new federal regulations.\u000a    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider\u000atrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that\u000atopped the agency's enforcement agenda during the\u000aadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\u000a    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with\u000aRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to\u000asignificantly alter the commission's current priorities.\u000a    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them\u000alawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that\u000afigure likely will be significantly higher next year as the\u000aagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.\u000a    The agency is one of the few in the government that\u000aactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past\u000afew years because of fees it charges public companies,\u000ainvestment banks and other securities firms it regulates.\u000a    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,\u000ameaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the\u000apresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing\u000afor policy differences alone.\u000a    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same\u000apolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget request\u000aeach year instead of leaving this to the White House.\u000a    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins\u000ato the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed\u000ain large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted\u000amarket manipulations by large investment firms.\u000a    The agency requires public companies and investment\u000avehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on\u000atheir financial condition and to disclose changes in their\u000acondition any time they issue new securities.\u000a    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to\u000aregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, and\u000ait polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.\u000a    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial\u000amagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to\u000abecome the nation's 35th president.\u000a    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served\u000afrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in\u000a1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's\u000afirst term and was Reagan's director of the Central\u000aIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.\u000a Reuter\u000a

Pipelines also\u000atransport its own gas to customers.\u000a    Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co <T> rejected the FERC\u000aguidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the\u000aregulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for\u000agas it has bought but could not sell.\u000a    The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay\u000acontracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term\u000acontracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as\u000acustomers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.\u000a    Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that\u000aTenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to\u000aopen-access because of the take-or-pay issue.\u000a    But Tenneco today said open access "is one of the steps\u000aFERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC\u000ais moving the industry through this restructuring now, even\u000abefore all transitional problems are solved."\u000a    A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure\u000aunder the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure\u000afor Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from\u000aLouisiana and Texas up to New England.\u000a    "We remain convinced that the most critical transitional\u000aissue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by\u000aFERC in the near future.\u000a    "A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the\u000aindustry's continued ability to provide its customers with\u000areliable natural gas," said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co\u000apresident R.C.

a(VThe economy faces lackluster growth\u000aand the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement\u000ain U.S. exports should falter, economists say.\u000a    Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness\u000ain the key housing and auto sectors and could be further\u000ahampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.\u000a    "These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength\u000ato keep the economy from tipping into a recession?" said Lyle\u000aGramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers\u000aAssociation and a former Federal Reserve Board official.\u000a    The Commerce Department said this week that the economy\u000agrew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but\u000aa U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.\u000a    Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending\u000arose a weak 0.1 per cent.\u000a    "Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --\u000aare faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, "\u000aMartin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,\u000atold Reuters.\u000a    Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow\u000abecause inflation is rising faster than real wages.\u000a    To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,\u000areturning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost\u000apersonal income and consumption, he says.\u000a    "I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to\u000akeep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,"\u000aGramley said.\u000a    Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters\u000athat the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the\u000aresult of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last\u000aand said the recovery was showing anemia.\u000a    Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, "The pace\u000aof the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into\u000amonetary policy" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be\u000aaccommodative.\u000a    Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct\u000aforecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if\u000athe dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add\u000ato the risk of a recession.\u000a    Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May\u000acame despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an\u000ainventory overhang still exists.\u000a    He says the boost in production came from smaller\u000aindustries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have\u000aimproved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.\u000a    "They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in\u000aeconomic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a\u000arecession," Mauro said.\u000a    In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl\u000aSprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the\u000atrade deficit will continue to improve.\u000a    "Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and\u000ainto 1988 are still quite favorable," he said.\u000a    But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in\u000ainflation.\u000a    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers\u000aInc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5\u000ato five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after\u000aa 1.1 pct increase in 1986.\u000a    The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil\u000aand energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.\u000a    "The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets\u000aout of the bottle, it continues to persist," he said, adding he\u000awould like the Fed to tighten credit.\u000a    A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the\u000adollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says\u000aa prominent international banker.\u000a    Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National\u000aPress Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and\u000athe mark will continue for years because the United States is\u000athe world's largest debtor nation.\u000a    The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a\u000afurther slackening of activity and called naive the belief that\u000athe five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.\u000a"It is very difficult to be optimistic," Gut said.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VThe six basis point rise of the past\u000amonth in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a\u000aseries of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the\u000adollar holds firm.\u000a    "Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis\u000apoints over the last month, largely over indications that\u000ainflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing\u000aU.S. trade balance, in nominal terms," Samuel Kahan, chief\u000afinancial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government\u000aSecurities, said.\u000a    Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in\u000athe economy during the first quarter, but his concern is\u000awhether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the\u000alonger term.\u000a    Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has\u000abecome more important to the direction of debt futures than the\u000abeneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.\u000a    The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer\u000aPrice Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down\u000a1.5 pct, respectively.\u000a    Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money\u000asupply announced this week was "surprising, much larger than\u000aexpected," according to Kahan. "Unless quickly reversed," such\u000aa trend "will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,"\u000aKahan said.\u000a    Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which\u000aKahan said have "slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board\u000aannual targets," the consequences could be a hint of economic\u000aweakness down the road, he said.\u000a    Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for\u000afurther gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,\u000aanalysts said.\u000a    September T-bonds "are up almost six points since about May\u000a18," Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September\u000abond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93\u000ain mid-June, Duggan said.\u000a    While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,\u000aand bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through\u000achart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted\u000aabove the 93 level.\u000a    "The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken\u000aout before this activity is anything other than a trading range\u000amarket," Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst\u000aBrian Singer said.\u000a    The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.\u000acurrency has made little headway of late, analysts said.\u000a    "The critical variable remaining in the market is the value\u000aof the dollar," Kahan said.\u000a    Additional influences next week will be possible\u000adevelopments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact\u000aand size of the U.S. budget deficit, "although these will not\u000abe in the forefront of the market early next week," Kahan said.\u000a    In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding\u000aauctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and\u000aThursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results\u000awith little excitement. However, a successful auction could\u000aprove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market\u000apsychology.\u000a Reuter\u000a

He said he expected OPEC to\u000araise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.\u000a    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly\u000ain the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and\u000athe likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to\u000amaintain steady prices.\u000a    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day\u000acompared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its\u000aexport capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline\u000athrough Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.\u000a    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,\u000aagainst its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up\u000ato 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.\u000a    Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating\u000aon the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price\u000adiscounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said.

The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and\u000awould now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.\u000a    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of\u000a16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and\u000aretained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord\u000abased on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.\u000a    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and\u000ait's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter\u000aceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth\u000aquarter.\u000a    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore\u000afields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from\u000aplanned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained\u000awithin its December accord on output and prices.\u000a    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around\u000a840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln\u000abpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.\u000a    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since\u000aFebruary reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.\u000a    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for\u000aa meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement\u000aon the latest oil production cutbacks.\u000a    Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC\u000aproducers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia\u000aand Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep\u000aprices stable.\u000a    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an\u000aOPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around\u000a18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.\u000a    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export\u000aearnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price\u000aduring the first half of 1986.\u000a    But firmer oil prices since then have brought some\u000astability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade\u000adeficit.\u000a     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently\u000arefused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to\u000athe producing oil companies to set the levels of production.\u000a REUTER\u000a

In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter\u000alevel of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter\u000atarget.\u000a    Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, "OPEC third\u000aquarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while\u000afourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd"\u000a    Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production\u000alevels would have on prices.\u000a    Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,\u000arising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to\u000aadhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln\u000abarrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia\u000aand Turkey.

a(VU.S. moves to increase its warships in\u000aand around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on\u000aunprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a\u000adirect military clash with Iran, diplomats said.\u000a    They said the American decision inevitably carries some\u000arisk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt\u000arhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.\u000a    "As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the\u000aGulf could do serious damage," said one western diplomat.\u000a    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks\u000aon "soft targets" such as merchant shipping not protected by\u000aAmerican or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.\u000a    The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil\u000atankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated\u000aby diplomats as low. However, "There is the threat that the\u000aIranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,\u000awill go for softer targets," one diplomat said.\u000a    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar\u000aHashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was\u000a"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us."\u000a    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10\u000awarships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to\u000apatrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.\u000a    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting\u000aKuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered\u000ato fly the American flag to give them naval protection.\u000a    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by\u000aIran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.\u000a    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by\u000aChinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is\u000apreparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.\u000a    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to\u000amake Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.\u000a    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a\u000alaunching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the\u000aFaw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.\u000a    "But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti\u000aterritory would be a very serious escalation" likely moving\u000aworld opinion against Iran, remarked one.\u000a    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying\u000aout reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.\u000a    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted\u000alast Friday "a river of blood" throughout the world in the event\u000aof any U.S. strike against Iran.\u000a    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused\u000aof being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable\u000acapacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.\u000a    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that\u000amost Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to\u000apro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential\u000atrouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.\u000a    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or\u000aother action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VIsrael's exports to the U.S. can and\u000amust double over the next five years if the mideast nation's\u000agoal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad\u000aYaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.\u000a    Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce\u000aseminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.\u000awere over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total\u000aexports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion\u000adlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.\u000a    "I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach\u000afive billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to\u000afunction in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis\u000aon product quality," Yaacobi said.\u000a    While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European\u000acurrencies is a "bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,"\u000aYaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend\u000atoward higher U.S. exports.\u000a    In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose\u000afivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while\u000aimports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.\u000a    Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct\u000aannually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\u000a     He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed\u000alast year and eliminating all duties and other commercial\u000arestrictions between the two nations through 1994, would\u000acontinue to facilitate the desired export growth.\u000a    Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as\u000aan economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.\u000afirms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage\u000aof the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.\u000a    Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle\u000aeast was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able\u000ato achieve its economic potential.\u000a    Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in\u000aaid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing\u000amilitary conflicts "which were imposed on Israel," he said.\u000a    Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,\u000aYaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic\u000aindependence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that\u000aexports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.\u000a Reuter\u000a

Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest\u000arates have risen substantially more," Poehl said.\u000a    This had to be taken into account when considering recent\u000arises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to\u000arising international money market rates that had spilled over\u000ainto the German market, he said.\u000a    Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far\u000aignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.\u000a    "The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is\u000adefinitely underway," he said, noting that this was not so\u000anoticeable in absolute figures.\u000a    The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also\u000aattracted little attention, he said.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VPlunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent\u000athe Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even\u000aforce it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,\u000agovernment and private economists said.\u000a    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark\u000afurther selling of shares that could ultimately have a major\u000adeflationary impact on the real economy, they said.\u000a    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently\u000amaintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount\u000arate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. \u000a    Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the\u000acentral bank's apparent decision last week to countenance\u000ahigher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.\u000a    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15\u000apct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to\u000araise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a\u000arenewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.\u000a    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the\u000amarkets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded\u000athe central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount\u000arate increase.\u000a    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.\u000aAnd Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a\u000afurther drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. "They need to\u000asupport the stock and security markets," he said.\u000a    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change\u000apolicy for the moment, although one admitted that the central\u000abank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices\u000acontinue to plunge during the rest of the week.\u000a    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the\u000aeconomy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary\u000aimpact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.\u000a    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in\u000astock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and\u000abusiness confidence, one government economist said.\u000a    "There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't\u000abe that big," said another.\u000a    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their\u000aown, although they do participate through trust funds and other\u000ainvestment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned\u000ato financial market investments for profits during last year's\u000aeconomic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to\u000arefocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.\u000a    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is\u000apartly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have\u000ashifted funds away from financial investments to increase\u000ainventories and step up capital spending, one government\u000aeconomist said.\u000a    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price\u000adrop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices\u000awill continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a\u000agreater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,\u000aone central bank official said.

a(VIran is preparing lawsuits to file for\u000acompensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf\u000aoil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister\u000aGholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.\u000a    The lawsuits would be filed with competent international\u000abodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted\u000atelling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the\u000adamage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.\u000a    The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American\u000adestroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after\u000athe attack, he said.\u000a    Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was\u000apreliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to\u000aa missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle\u000aCity in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.\u000a    He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs\u000a"except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence." Reacting to\u000aWeinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,\u000aAqazadeh said: "Iran will also consider the case closed after\u000aits retaliatory measure." Iranian officials have said their\u000aresponse would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests\u000aaround the world might come under attack.\u000a    Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf\u000aaggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's\u000aoil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack\u000asignificantly affecting oil prices.\u000a    IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the\u000aattack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the\u000aentrance to the Gulf.\u000a    "If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can\u000aeither, and this would be to everyone's harm," the radio quoted\u000ahim as saying.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VIranian Premier Mir-Hossein Mousavi\u000areiterated his country would retaliate for U.S. Navy attacks on\u000aGulf oil platforms.\u000a    "The U.S. Attack on Iran's oil platforms jeopardises our\u000anational sovereignty ... And we will retaliate properly for\u000athis perfidious American aggression," Mousavi told a news\u000aconference in Damascus.  On Monday U.S. Navy warships blasted\u000athe Rostam platform, and Navy personnel stormed a second\u000aplatform a few miles away. Washington said the operation was\u000aaimed at destroying positions used by Iran to track and assault\u000aneutral Gulf shipping.\u000a\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VA voluntary compliance system for\u000amonitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed\u000askeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and\u000atrade sources.\u000a    "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and \u000aimporters, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of\u000athe past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it\u000abecame a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one\u000aanalyst said.\u000a    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said\u000athe Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a\u000avoluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to\u000amonitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.\u000a    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee\u000aimporters would voluntarily present needed documents to the\u000aU.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring\u000aauthority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,\u000ait will still be allowed entry.\u000a    While many believe producers will not seek to add to the\u000aoverburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some\u000awill ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of\u000amonitoring controls, trade sources said.\u000a    "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted\u000ato customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a\u000aU.S. Customs spokesman said.\u000a    "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when\u000aits hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand\u000aForm O (documents tracking merchandise from source to\u000adestination)," he said.\u000a    Many see it as a true test of whether producers and\u000aimporters will abide by the quota system.\u000a    "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the\u000aquota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.\u000a     "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did\u000anot act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without\u000athe need to submit documents, the ball will be in the\u000aproducers' hands."\u000a    Some feel that importers will take advantage of the\u000avoluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,\u000ain which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.\u000aMany fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member\u000acountries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely\u000alabelled.\u000a    According to customs officials, several green coffee\u000aimporters confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee\u000afraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,\u000aforging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy\u000abeans.\u000a    "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for\u000aone country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of\u000atheir stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by\u000acircumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst\u000aBernie Savaiko.\u000a    Still, others believe that producers will not be hard\u000apressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in\u000athe U.S. in the near term.\u000a    "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not\u000ahave some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system\u000aseemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so\u000amuch coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a\u000athreat," one trader said.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VU.S. And West German reaffirmation of\u000asupport for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental\u000aproblems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the\u000acurrent collapse in stock markets, London economists said.\u000a    "There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the\u000adollar is going to be allowed to slip," said Richard Jeffrey of\u000aHoare Govett. "If not, there is going to be continued fear that\u000awhen pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to\u000atighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the\u000aU.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world."\u000a    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which\u000adragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the\u000avery problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation\u000afears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.\u000a    "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street\u000a...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," said\u000aGeoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from\u000aother London and Tokyo analysts.\u000a    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of\u000afurther falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary\u000apressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.\u000a    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the\u000aequity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.\u000a    "It would be suicidal for any government in the context of\u000awhat happened in the last couple of days to jack up their\u000ainterest rates," he added.\u000a    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime\u000alending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed\u000achairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial\u000asystem.\u000a    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock\u000acollapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking\u000acrisis for example, thus precipitating recession.\u000a    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of\u000a1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said\u000atoday's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and\u000athat markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in\u000amind.\u000a    "The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.\u000aIf the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic\u000agrowth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a\u000amore realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy," said Capel's\u000aDennis. But he added that markets are still very much in\u000adanger.\u000a    "The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is\u000adisappearing from the equity markets," Dennis noted.\u000a    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world\u000amarket turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven\u000a(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,\u000aas implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard\u000aStoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies\u000ais still on.\u000a    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by\u000aexpectations that the Germans were more worried about the money\u000asupply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency\u000astability.\u000a    But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said\u000aMorrison.

a(VAn unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg\u000asurge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to\u000anudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as\u000along as sterling remains in its present robust state,\u000aeconomists said.\u000a    An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the\u000apast two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit\u000ademand which has largely been behind growth in lending.\u000a    "In the normal course of events the markets would have been\u000aextremely worried about that figure," noted Peter Spencer, U.K.\u000aEconomist with Credit Suisse First Boston.\u000a    After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,\u000awhich compared won stg August rise, U.K.\u000aGovernment bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee\u000afrom plummetting equities into the relative security of\u000agovernment securities.\u000a    Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a\u000aday's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,\u000abefore staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone\u000athroughout.\u000a    U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,\u000aresumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning\u000aafter little more than a token blip as the figures came out.\u000a    Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks\u000awould under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a\u000arise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "With\u000athe financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last\u000athing the Bank of England would want to do," Spencer said.\u000a    "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as\u000asterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"\u000asaid Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu\u000aGilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money\u000ameasure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct\u000agrowth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.\u000a    But "The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed\u000adown is a rather encouraging sign," noted Paul Temperton, U.K.\u000aEconomist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a\u000afall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money\u000aaggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.\u000a    It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank\u000aof England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates\u000ato 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by\u000anews of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.\u000a    Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in\u000athat period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.\u000a    Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in\u000ainfluencing consumer behaviour, he said.\u000a    In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity\u000amarkets in the past few days, "There will almost certainly be a\u000astraightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail\u000asales," Temperton said.\u000a    "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in\u000aconsumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added.\u000a    "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending\u000afigure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very\u000aserious panic and a flight to quality," Spencer said.\u000a    A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look\u000aat all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,\u000aadding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly\u000athan bank lending.\u000a    Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending\u000awas evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy\u000apersonal sector borrowing.\u000a    Figures from the Banking Information Service showed\u000apersonal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66\u000abillion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise.

a(VNorway's September oil output rose by 22.2\u000apct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in\u000aAugust, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.\u000a    Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at\u000aseveral of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at\u000afields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field\u000arescue project.\u000a    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's\u000avoluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil\u000aoutput, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise\u000aoil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.\u000a    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the\u000aproduction restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all\u000aits North Sea fields for the rest of the year.\u000a    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway\u000awould extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.\u000a    The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which\u000apumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,\u000afield operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.\u000a    Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use\u000athe Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while\u000aPhillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.\u000a    BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula\u000afield, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping\u000ato 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.\u000a    Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd\u000alast month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company\u000asaid.\u000a    September production was also sharply higher at the\u000aStatfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which\u000aextends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd\u000aagainst 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats\u000aOljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.\u000a    Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like\u000aStatfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd\u000ain September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous\u000amonth, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.\u000a    Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd\u000ain September, compared with 100,188 in August.\u000a    Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test\u000aoutput at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl\u000atotalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in\u000aAugust.\u000a    Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on\u000astream a second well, cutting September production to just two\u000adays.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VU.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard\u000aLyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a\u000aglobal farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the\u000aUnited States opposes key parts of the proposal.\u000a    "We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.\u000aIt will help us in getting the negotiations underway," Lyng\u000atold Reuters in an interview Tuesday.\u000a    Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg\u000aendorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.\u000aThe EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay\u000around agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.\u000a    Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan\u000aseeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing\u000acurbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.\u000a    The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all\u000afarm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has\u000apressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching\u000aa global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.\u000a    However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the\u000aReagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is\u000aunrealistic.\u000a    Asked about such criticism, Lyng said "The alternative to\u000adoing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I\u000athink that is the unrealistic position."\u000a    "I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are\u000atrying to say."\u000a    Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a\u000afreeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations \u000astarted.\u000a    "All that some countries would like to have would be a\u000awheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.\u000aThat doesn't do a thing for us," Lyng said.\u000a    The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of\u000aagricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he\u000asaid.\u000a    At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is\u000aexpected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.\u000a    The United States will be represented at the meeting by\u000aformer agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently\u000aappointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VThe European Community's farmers'\u000apressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax\u000aon vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax\u000awhich has already been proposed by the EC Commission.\u000a    Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on\u000aTuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism\u000afor cereal substitutes.\u000a    He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the\u000aDanish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair\u000ameetings of their EC colleagues.\u000a    Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help\u000athe EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability\u000afor producers.\u000a    This would in turn help the market position for certain\u000acrops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas\u000aand beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe\u000aoutput restrictions.\u000a    A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax\u000aon imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats\u000asucceeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC\u000aprice fixing.\u000a    However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its\u000aproposals for a tax.\u000a    Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue\u000ainternational negotiations on farm trade with the aim of\u000abridging the gap between EC and world prices.\u000a Reuter\u000a

But EC oilseeds production\u000ahas risen dramatically since then.\u000a    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world\u000amarket levels and is considering implementing a controversial\u000aoils and fats tax.\u000a    The subsidies "are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero\u000aduty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell," Adams\u000asaid.\u000a    The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its\u000atrade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an\u000aEC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the\u000aEC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.\u000a    U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in\u000avolume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of\u000aEC policies, Adams added.\u000a    Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at\u000athe conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973\u000awhen the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VThe United States is prepared to "pull out\u000aall the stops" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the\u000aGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador\u000ato GATT Michael Samuels said.\u000a    Those rights are now being challenged by the European\u000aCommunity's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a\u000aconference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.\u000a    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if\u000athe EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without\u000athe issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.\u000a    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect\u000aon January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat\u000ashipments into the EC.\u000a    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.\u000atrade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed\u000aprices over the current market level and which may be extended\u000ato include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.\u000a    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,\u000aan aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade\u000anegotiations, "is meaningless if import barriers continue to be\u000aerected," Samuels said.\u000a    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm\u000asubsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, "visionary"\u000aand "very serious."  The EC and Japan have said it is\u000aunrealistic.\u000a    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal\u000aon farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally\u000anext week.\u000a    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce\u000atensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals\u000asubstitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of\u000afarm subsidies.\u000a    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as\u000athey are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major\u000atrade distortions, Samuels said.\u000a    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally\u000asubmitted and respond to it officially then.\u000a    "We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este\u000adeclaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"\u000athe U.S. Ambassador said.\u000a    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores\u000athe U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.\u000a    The key difference between the two approaches is that the\u000aU.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing\u000aonly for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.\u000a    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,\u000athere would be little incentive for the Community to work to\u000acorrect the international trade situation, he added.\u000a    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC\u000aoilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to\u000athird countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the\u000aU.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VThe United States appears to have won a\u000atransatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest\u000arates, European economists said.\u000a    But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing\u000athe limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were\u000aplunging.\u000a    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.\u000aTreasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to\u000acurrency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,\u000aaccording to official statements released late Monday.\u000a    Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the\u000aBundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks\u000aliquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct\u000afacility rate offered last week.\u000a    While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank\u000apresident Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added\u000amoney market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a\u000astrong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.\u000a     "It's round one to the Americans, " said Richard Reid,\u000asenior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in\u000aLondon.\u000a    But Reid added, "We shouldn't forget that it has taken one\u000aof the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West\u000aGermans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05\u000apercentage point."\u000a    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening\u000aof West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and\u000afuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.\u000a    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's\u000aLouvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary\u000apolicies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -\u000athe US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.\u000a    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets\u000aand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading\u000ain New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was\u000aquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.\u000a    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche\u000aGenossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world\u000astock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West\u000aGerman short-term interest rates on Tuesday.\u000a    "The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market\u000alosses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits\u000awith Baker's wishes, then all the better," he said.\u000a    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the\u000aBundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises\u000ain the U.S., Aschoff said.\u000a    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central\u000abank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he\u000athought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.\u000a    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston\u000aLtd in London said "The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat\u000aand Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the\u000asecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was\u000abefore the IMF meeting last month in Washington."\u000a    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was\u000areaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity\u000aat 3.60 pct, Keating noted.\u000a    Economists said the United States now appeared to have\u000aagreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support\u000athe dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.\u000a    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder\u000aWashington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg\u000atold a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule\u000aout central banks of leading industrial countries intervening\u000aon exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.\u000a    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West\u000aGermany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency\u000astability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central\u000abanks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them\u000ato again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VThe European Community (EC) agreed a\u000atrade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country\u000afollowing the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC\u000aofficials said.\u000a    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina\u000awill gain additional trading rights on a series of products\u000aincluding meat, fish and cereals by-products.\u000a    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with\u000aCanada and Japan and are due to study these again, the\u000aofficials said.\u000a    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC\u000astates after West Germany withdrew objections to increased\u000aquotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.\u000a    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,\u000asaying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals\u000asubstitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the\u000aofficials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from\u000aimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the\u000aquota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500\u000atonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will\u000abe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.\u000a    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of\u000a5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced\u000alevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.\u000a    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said\u000athat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their\u000aexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They\u000ahave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement\u000aon Tariffs and Trade).\u000a    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve\u000aCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had\u000abeen affected by the country's EC membership.\u000a    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the\u000afish dispute with Canada.\u000a    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC\u000aclaims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has\u000aimproved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied\u000awith Japanese offers of compensation.\u000a    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on\u000acitrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some\u000aother farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear\u000aand to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.\u000a    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told\u000ajournalists: "We maintain our position that the (Japanese)\u000aconcessions were not enough."\u000a    "We hope that there will be an improvement," he said.\u000a Reuter\u000a

Secretary General\u000aJavier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a\u000aSecurity Council call for a ceasefire.\u000a    "We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any\u000achance at all," he said, adding that the action made it clear\u000atougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.\u000a\u000a   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon\u000ato have been turned into a military command post -- Washington\u000aalso sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's\u000aeconomic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had\u000abeen used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the\u000alower Gulf.\u000a    "We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown\u000aIran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting\u000acapabilities," Cordesman said.\u000a    He predicted the United States would respond to any future\u000amajor Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar\u000aAbbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the\u000aapproaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.\u000a    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the\u000aUnited States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, "but\u000awe will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action\u000aby Iran with stronger countermeasures." \u000a Reuter\u000a

For the remaining 52.6\u000apct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one\u000aIrving share.\u000a    At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to\u000a80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per\u000ashare for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.\u000a    According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender\u000afor all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.\u000a    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would\u000aaffect the acquisition.\u000a    "If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve\u000ait, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"\u000asaid Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.\u000a    "And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"\u000aAlpert said.\u000a    "The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at\u000apresent.

a(VAs official Washington sought to\u000arestore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street\u000acollapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from\u000acritics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.\u000a    Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for\u000aboosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an\u000ainternational accord to stabilize currency values.\u000a    Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was\u000aamong those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped\u000aspur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors\u000athink that a clash between the two major economic powers would\u000adamage the world economy.\u000a    Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, "I\u000athink the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I\u000athink, was partly due to statements that have been made by\u000asenior figures on the other side of the Atlantic." It was a\u000adispute that should never have happened, he added.\u000a    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a\u000ahastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  \u000astill faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United\u000aStates on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to\u000aScandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.\u000a    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, "His\u000atiming could not have been worse."\u000a    One government bond salesman in New York said, "He actually\u000athought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack\u000athe dollar down would work. That doesn't show much\u000aunderstanding of international monetary gamesmanship."\u000a    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march\u000atoward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.\u000a    "On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if\u000ayou go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial\u000amarkets), it was West German policy," said Robert Brusca of\u000aNikko Securities International in New York.\u000a    "All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so\u000amaking him responsible for it was a little like killing the\u000amessenger," he said.\u000a    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments\u000amade it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together\u000ain Paris in February, was still in effect.\u000a    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be\u000aa prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to\u000athe late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash\u000awiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.\u000a   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about\u000aBonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the\u000aglobal recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest\u000arate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.\u000a    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th\u000amonth, could no longer be the only engine of global economic\u000aexpansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge\u000amarket for debtor country exports.\u000a    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried\u000athat the Republican party might face next year's presidential\u000aelection with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly\u000atarnished.\u000a    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt\u000acrisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has\u000aalready slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.\u000a    "There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the\u000aeconomy, and it's important that the psychology turn around\u000aquickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and\u000aeventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,"\u000aformer deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a\u000atelevision interview.\u000a    In many ways, the official response was mild.\u000a    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,\u000awith President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting\u000athat he was "puzzled."\u000a    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately\u000areturned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments\u000aand, presumably, their political impact.\u000a    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in\u000aWashington will diminish because of the market fall.\u000a    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because\u000aof the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd\u000aBentsen said with some irony, "Oh, I think it's much too late to\u000abe doing that...You have an administration that's taken the\u000aattitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---\u000aretire to the living room to take a nap.

a(VTrade Representative Clayton Yeutter\u000asaid on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada\u000aand Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the\u000aglobal trading system.\u000a    He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back\u000aworldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs\u000aand Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.\u000a    The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay\u000ato liberalize the global trading system and to include in it\u000atrade in agriculture and services such as banking.\u000a    Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting\u000amarking the second year of their bilateral accord. The\u000aCanadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet\u000abeen approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.\u000a    The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove\u000atariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and\u000amany services.\u000a    Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli\u000apacts "other countries have realized that if they want to\u000acontinue to have access to the world's largest market, they had\u000abetter get serious about improving the GATT."\u000a    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing\u000ashipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially\u000aincrease the gross national products in both countries.\u000a    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should\u000aserve as important precedents for progress in GATT.\u000a    Yeutter said, "increasing trade is one of the keys to\u000aenhanced political and economic stability around the globe."\u000a    He said, "a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only\u000afor advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries\u000athat need to increase trade in order to better their standards\u000aof living."\u000a    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress\u000amade in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to\u000aprotectionism.\u000a    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress\u000athat would force the United States to take retaliatory actions\u000aagainst nations with large trade surpluses with the United\u000aStates if the countries practiced unfair trade.\u000a    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade\u000adeficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still\u000arising.\u000a    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to\u000aresist, but the pending legislation would undermine President\u000aReagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.\u000a    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.\u000a    He said, "President Reagan will veto any bill that contains\u000aserious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained."\u000a Reuter\u000a

It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.\u000a    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market\u000areacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest\u000arates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that\u000aWest Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.\u000a    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to\u000acoordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with\u000athe surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating\u000atheir economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget\u000adeficit.\u000a    West German government sources said rising West German\u000amoney market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre\u000apact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest\u000arates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising\u000asince May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed\u000araised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.\u000a    German yields have also risen over this period, but less\u000amarkedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up\u000ashort-term rates by changing the terms on its security\u000arepurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the\u000amoney market.\u000a    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,\u000acompared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's\u000ainability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,\u000abut also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the\u000aBundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary\u000agrowth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,\u000abank economists said.\u000a    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the\u000apragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl\u000asince early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the\u000amore cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.\u000a    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,\u000athe Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this\u000amorning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.\u000aanger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.\u000a    "They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much\u000aunder American fire," said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at\u000aSwiss Bank Corp here.\u000a    "It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a\u000asignificant retreat from its position," added Giles Keating,\u000aeconomist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.\u000a    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of\u000athe Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact\u000aon Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market\u000aeconomists said.\u000a    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank\u000adoes not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation\u000arate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,\u000alittle changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.\u000a    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication\u000athat the meeting would take place, although the Finance\u000aMinistry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.\u000a    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to\u000acomment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre\u000aaccord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he\u000aassumed monetary cooperation would continue.\u000a    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West\u000aGermany for Sweden on Monday.

Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.\u000aTrade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal\u000a"blatantly discriminates" against imports, would be impossible to\u000adefend under international trade law and would harm relations\u000awith the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.\u000a    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their\u000asaturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively\u000alittle from tropical oils.\u000a    The committee voted largely along party lines, with three\u000aDemocrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.\u000a Reuter\u000a

If vital supplies were cut off,\u000aTehran could not continue the war with Iraq.\u000a    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic\u000ainitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an\u000aarms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.\u000a    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and\u000ablockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to\u000aacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a\u000asettlement.\u000a    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by\u000ainvading Iran's territory in 1980.

It's up to Tehran to\u000arespond one way or the other," a diplomat said.\u000a    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American\u000acountermeasures if the military escalation continued.\u000a    Western diplomats and military sources in the area said\u000ashelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act\u000athe United States could have taken once it had decided to\u000aretaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans\u000aand Kuwaitis on Iran.\u000a    "It's interesting that they chose something in international\u000awaters because it doesn't implicate any other nation," one\u000adiplomat said. "This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf\u000aArab states, particularly Kuwait."\u000a    Commented another diplomat: "Kuwait must be happy that the\u000aU.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked\u000aon its doorstep."\u000a    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: "They\u000amanaged to warn off the crew and hit something that was the\u000aleast nuisance to everybody."\u000a    A diplomat commented: "They were very clever in the place\u000athey chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated\u000aanything because it wasn't working in the first place."\u000a    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:\u000a"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up\u000a...

Eugene Carroll\u000aof Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)\u000athink tank.\u000a    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for\u000aWashington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to\u000athe war between Iran and Iraq.\u000a    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its\u000a30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began\u000aescorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal \u000awould give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which\u000aPresident Reagan could never accept.\u000a    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon\u000anews conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel\u000afired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam\u000aoil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf\u000atime (0700 EDT) on Monday.\u000a    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military\u000abase by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian\u000aSilkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea\u000aIsle City on Friday.\u000a    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and\u000aallowed to escape.\u000a    "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will\u000abe prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran\u000awith stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.\u000a    "We consider this matter closed," he said.\u000a    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives\u000aagreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not\u000aescalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was\u000awhether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken\u000athis view after earlier clashes.\u000a Reuter\u000a

He said the current debt-service ratio (over 40 pct\u000aof export revenue) was too high.\u000a    Yugoslavia is to negotiate a long-term restructuring of its\u000adebt after missing repayments in recent months, Mikulic said.\u000a    "If we did not change the dynamics of repaying our debt, the\u000asituation would become increasingly worse," Mikulic said.\u000a    He said on the present repayment schedule, Yugoslavia would\u000ahave a net outflow of two billion dlrs and the level of debt\u000awould be halved by 1995. But he added:\u000a    "The consequences would not only mean slower economic growth\u000ain the coming years but also further exhaustion of the economy\u000aand lasting damage to the economy's capacity for development,"\u000ahe said.\u000a    "All that would, of course, intensify social difficulties,"\u000aMikulic added.\u000a    The state news agency Tanjug said on October 9 that\u000aYugoslavia plans to adjust debt repayments over the next eight\u000ayears and to cut the debt-service ratio to 25 pct.\u000a    Yugoslavia failed to make a principal repayment due last\u000amonth which had already been postponed by 90 days.\u000a    Mikulic's proposed economic program, which also includes\u000ahigher personal taxes as well as wage and price restraint, is\u000aintended to serve as a basis for the debt talks to demonstrate\u000aYugoslavia's ability to eventually repay the credits.\u000a    His program has to be discussed and approved by parliament\u000aby early November.\u000a    Mikulic said foreign debt should be retained at about the\u000asame level as now until 1990 and the country should then be\u000aable to keep currency reserves equal to three months payments.\u000a    "Of course, these are our proposals for talks with\u000acreditors. We expect understanding and support because it is in\u000atheir interest as well," Mikulic said.\u000a    He said that under the present schedule debt payments had\u000aslowed economic development and exhausted currency reserves.\u000aBanking sources say Yugoslavia's reserves are inadequate at\u000apresent for even one month's debt and import bill.\u000a REUTER\u000a

Reuter and\u000aInternational Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September\u000aproduction at 18.5 mln bpd.\u000a    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of\u000aa Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea\u000aIsle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,\u000ain Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag\u000acommercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.\u000a    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the\u000aarea on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.\u000a    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on\u000aMonday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.\u000aAttack, analysts said.\u000a    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which\u000aaround eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in\u000athe interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.\u000a    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in\u000athe number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf\u000ahostilities, analysts said.\u000a    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian\u000amissile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.\u000a    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,\u000asaid he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.\u000a    "The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond\u000ato Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any\u000afurther action will be met with a like-for-like response.\u000aToday's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory," Pyne said.\u000a    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was "a\u000aresponsible retaliation," with the U.S. Apparently indicating to\u000aIran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran\u000achose to raise the level of conflict.\u000a    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.\u000a    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as\u000aArab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests\u000athe U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a\u000aresult of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian\u000aretaliation.\u000a    The initial upward market move this morning reflected a\u000astrong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which\u000awas thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile\u000alaunchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.\u000a    The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy\u000aattack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary\u000aCaspar Weinburger.\u000a    Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the\u000aGulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less\u000aserious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,\u000aanalysts and traders said.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VThe Louvre accord on currency stability,\u000awhich has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since\u000alast February, appeared in serious danger today as a\u000atransatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to\u000athe boil, foreign exchange dealers said.\u000a    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and\u000abond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial\u000acountries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem\u000abetween the United States and West Germany and insisted that\u000athe currency pact was still alive.\u000a    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market\u000afears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term\u000ainterest rates. "That's not in keeping with the spirit of what\u000awe agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,"\u000aBaker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was\u000areferring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group\u000aof Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the\u000apact.\u000a    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both\u000ahave large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic\u000agrowth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.\u000aAgreed to stop talking the dollar down.\u000a    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre\u000aagreement was still operative, the West German interest rate\u000amove would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.\u000a    "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that\u000ahe's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets\u000aare off in terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currency\u000aanalyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.\u000a    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine\u000aview, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is apparently\u000areacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker\u000acomment will regret it later on."\u000a    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the\u000aLouvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to\u000arespond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for "a faithful\u000aand firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the\u000aLouvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."\u000a    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British\u000aTreasury commented on the row.\u000a    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite\u000aU.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this does\u000anot represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the\u000aLouvre Accord."\u000a    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive\u000aof West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that\u000afollowing recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.\u000aWas still committed to the accord.\u000a    In a move which the market interpreted as a possible\u000agesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term\u000aliquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on\u000aMonday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected\u000amedium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also\u000astepped into the French money market to hold down rates,\u000ainjecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose\u000aclose to eight pct.\u000a Reuter\u000a

a(VThe Soviet Union outlined its economic\u000atargets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve\u000astandards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.\u000a    Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet\u000aindustrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a\u000aplanned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.\u000a    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent\u000ato gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a\u000aplanned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the\u000aoutput of a country's goods and services.\u000a    He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of\u000agrain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow\u000aproduced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.\u000a    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described\u000amachine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is\u000aessential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on\u000aworld markets.\u000a    "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the\u000amachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a\u000aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires," said\u000aTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.\u000a    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes\u000amachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,\u000aincreased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987\u000acompared with the same period last year.\u000a    However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned\u000afor the industry for the whole of 1988.\u000a    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent\u000ameeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to\u000aa large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scale\u000ameasures are planned to save resources," he said.\u000a    Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that\u000adefense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same\u000afigure as was announced last year.\u000a    Western governments view official Soviet estimates for\u000adefense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure\u000ais hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are\u000aintertwined with the civilian economy.\u000a    Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending\u000anext year on medical services, education, pensions and social\u000ainsurance schemes.\u000a Reuter\u000a

The economy is not receiving a\u000aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires," said\u000aTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.\u000a    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes\u000amachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,\u000aincreased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of this\u000ayear against the same period of 1986. This is well below the\u000a7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.\u000a    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recent\u000ameeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to\u000aa large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scale\u000ameasures are planned to save resources," he said.\u000a    Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Soviet\u000adefence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, the\u000asame as announced last year.\u000a    Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increase\u000aspending next year on medical services, education, pensions and\u000asocial insurance schemes\u000a    He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171\u000abillion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than had\u000aoriginally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Plan.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VSaudi Arabia is likely to remain the key\u000asupplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least\u000athe next five years, oil industry sources said.\u000a    Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and\u000abutane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi\u000aArabian LPG, the sources said.\u000a    They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate\u000aof crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. "Saudi\u000ais a reliable supplier in that sense," said one trader.\u000a    Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.\u000a    No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an\u000aLPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.\u000a    "Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,\u000awhich has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf\u000acould easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities\u000ain that area," said another trader.\u000a    Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20\u000apct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at\u000aAl-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to\u000acontractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from\u000aother ports.\u000a    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude\u000arather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG\u000asupply disruptions, traders said.\u000a    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was\u000aunlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.\u000a    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly\u000arise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a\u000amoderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.\u000a    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift\u000aslightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from\u000aIndonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.\u000a    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in\u000alarge scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian\u000aLPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the\u000ayear ended March 1987, the sources said.\u000a    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down\u000aterm purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on\u000athe spot market, they said.\u000a    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which\u000a5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term\u000acontracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of\u000aJapan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.\u000a    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made\u000asome concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the\u000arecent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the\u000aJapanese will accept the offer, the sources said.\u000a    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been\u000aunsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to\u000areplace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.\u000a    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by\u000aPetromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87\u000apct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)\u000aof Arabian Light.\u000a    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings\u000ashould the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian\u000aLight's GSP.\u000a    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the\u000a95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,\u000athe trade sources said.\u000a    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying\u000aup to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to\u000aseller-buyer agreement.\u000a    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut\u000asupplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.\u000a    "If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable\u000abasis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct," said\u000aan official at a major importer. "Freight costs are higher for\u000acargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a\u000alonger haul and war risk insurance payments."\u000a    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to\u000afinalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on\u000acontractual period and volume, which could be very similar to\u000acurrent levels, the sources said. "When we talk business, we\u000awould seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of\u000ahigh dependence on a single supplier," said one.\u000a REUTER\u000a

For years the softly-spoken economist has been\u000awarning in speech after speech that excessive money supply\u000agrowth would eventually lead to rising prices.\u000a    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank\u000acouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his\u000aviews, bankers said.\u000a    "Poehl is in a minority in his own house," said Commerzbank's\u000aPfister.\u000a    "Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not\u000aentirely his own," said another economist.\u000a    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,\u000athey will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark\u000aand hurting West German exporters.\u000a    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the\u000aBundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.\u000a    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James\u000aBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.\u000a    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986\u000awar of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.\u000aOfficials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to\u000astimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.\u000a    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round\u000aof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.\u000a    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for\u000aStoltenberg than he had bargained for.\u000a    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted\u000amost popular government politician last year, had to face\u000aresistance from local barons in the government coalition\u000aparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.\u000a    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising\u000a4.3 billion marks.\u000a    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will\u000apush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the\u000agovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.\u000a    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row\u000awhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal.\u000a    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last\u000amonth early to sort out a row in the northern state of\u000aSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.\u000a    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after\u000aallegations of a "dirty tricks" election campaign led to heavy\u000alosses for the CDU in state elections.\u000a    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last\u000aweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.\u000a    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more\u000aremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and\u000awas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\u000a    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this\u000ayear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government\u000agave Poehl another eight-year term.\u000a    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he\u000ahoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.\u000a    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was\u000anot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the\u000aBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.\u000a REUTER\u000a

a(VThe Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations\u000astill comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize\u000acurrencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.\u000a    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the\u000aweekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower\u000arange for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of\u000aJapan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.\u000a    "The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and\u000aanyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it\u000alater on," the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.\u000a    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the\u000adollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he\u000anoted.\u000a    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in\u000amonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would\u000anever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar\u000aagainst the mark or the yen.\u000a    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between\u000a140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.\u000a    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and\u000a141.35 yen.\u000a    "Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher\u000ainterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this\u000adoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework\u000aof the Louvre accord," the Finance Ministry official said.\u000a    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any\u000afurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only\u000ahurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt\u000aproblem.\u000a    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their\u000ainterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets\u000afurther, the monetary officials said.\u000a    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined\u000ato be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further\u000adecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary\u000aexpectations in the U.S.\u000a    "That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre\u000aagreement is still operative," the senior ministry official\u000asaid.\u000a    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that\u000aWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West\u000aGermany's increase in short-term interest rates.\u000a    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.\u000aWould be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar\u000adecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,\u000atry harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the\u000aaccord, foreign exchange dealers said.\u000a    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional\u000astatement that "the Louvre agreement is still operative," and\u000athis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the\u000adealers said.\u000a    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in\u000aTokyo currency markets.\u000a    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised\u000apressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates\u000ahigher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,\u000aor international economic policy coordination.\u000a    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,\u000aFrance, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's\u000aeconomic policies and from time to time apply "peer pressure" to\u000apersuade others to change their policies to a desired course,\u000athey noted. "Without such a basic agreement of multilateral\u000asurveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German\u000apolicy so openly," the ministry official said.\u000a    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy\u000ashould thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy\u000acoordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse\u000aof the Louvre agreement, the official said.\u000a    He also said Japan has not received any specific request\u000afrom the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term\u000amoney rates have been edging higher.\u000a    "This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking\u000apolicy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate\u000arise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons," he\u000aadded.\u000a REUTER\u000a

The quality of buffer stock rubber sold\u000asince he entered the market in September would be discussed at\u000aan INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said.\u000a    Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in\u000abuying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible\u000apoor quality.\u000a    Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the\u000a"may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO's\u000afive-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October\u000a16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock\u000awas uppermost in consumers' minds.\u000a    "We have received good interest for the rubber. I understand\u000athe Japanese concern.

a(VThe Soviet Union's industrial output is\u000agrowing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade\u000ahas fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.\u000a    Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show\u000aindustrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of\u000a1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.\u000a    Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986\u000aperiod as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2\u000apct.\u000a    Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion\u000aroubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.\u000a    One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction\u000aof a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last\u000ayear's calculations of industrial output included all goods,\u000airrespective of quality.\u000a    Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader\u000aMikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special\u000ainspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below\u000astandard.\u000a    Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were\u000arejected in the nine-month period.\u000a    The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more\u000athan 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000\u000apeople. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,\u000aPravda said, without giving comparative figures.\u000a    The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the\u000aeconomy has been an important part of the modernisation\u000acampaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the\u000asetting up of small shops on a private basis.\u000a    Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months\u000aagainst 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.\u000a    But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity\u000afigures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in\u000athe West, which measures worker output over a given period.\u000a    Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union\u000aas of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5\u000amln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period\u000alast year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against\u000a194 roubles a year ago.\u000a REUTER\u000a
